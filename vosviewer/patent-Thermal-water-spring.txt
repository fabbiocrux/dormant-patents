An anti-scald device is housed                within the anti-scald cavity of the polymeric                manifold housing, where the anti-scald device                comprises a thermal actuator (440) coupled to a                plunger (442). The thermal actuator and the plunger                are held in an open position within the anti-scald                cavity with a bias spring (444), where mixed water                from the mixing cavity is configured to flow to a                sensing region (460) of the anti-scald cavity to                the mixed water outlet. The thermal actuator is                configured to expand such that the thermal actuator                moves the plunger of the anti-scald device along a                longitudinal axis of the anti-scald cavity to a                closed position to close off a hot water                inlet.    USE - Anti-scald assembly for a tap housing of a                plumbing fixture. Uses include but are not limited                to lavatory tap assembly, kitchen tap assembly and                sink tap assembly.    ADVANTAGE - The anti-scald device reduces or stops water                from exiting the tap assembly when temperature of                the mixed water in the mixing cavity of the                assembly reaches or exceeds a predetermined                threshold so as to prevent scalding. The assembly                reduces a number of components required,                installation space required and/or additional                associated installation costs of adding the                separate anti-scald device. The plastic manifold                reduces an amount of heat transfer from hot water                to the manifold so as to increase efficiency of a                tap assembly, thus reducing heat transfer and                allowing the anti-scald device to reset                quickly.

A spring                (8) acts on the output shaft to urge the output                shaft towards the closed position. A latch (28)                restrains the output shaft against movement towards                the closed position under the influence of the                spring. A thermal actuator (30) operates                mechanically to release the latch in response to an                ambient temperature crossing a threshold                value.

ADVANTAGE - The controller opens or closes the valve in                response to the ambient temperature crossing the                threshold value, so that the continued supply of                water to pipes that to be frozen and burst is                prevented. The output shaft is restrained from                turning and the valve is prevented from closing                under the influence of the spring. The valve                controller drives the valve to the closed position                and prevents the water flowing into pipes that are                liable to become frozen. The damage caused by                resuming the supply of water to the pipe after                burst is prevented.

The spring-loaded by-pass valve (2) then opens to allow flow through the primary side of the heat exchanger back to the boiler. On cessation of demand for hot water, the flow switch returns control to the motorised valve causing it to open, and allowing the by-pass valve to close. If thermostatic radiator valves are used in the heating circuit, the spring-loaded by-pass valve also maintains a set differential pressure across the system, and prevents pump overload by providing a flow path via the heat exchanger. The boiler may be provided with a thermal store.    USE -   For combination boiler, e.g. with thermal store and heat exchanger.    ADVANTAGE -   Avoids differential pressure variation and system noise.

The valve provides a supplementary air passage which provides intake air to the engine suction line, bypassing the main throttle valve during starting and cold running conditions. A thermal sensor body (15) is located inside a thermal sensor cooling water chamber (20b) which is connected in the engine cooling water circuit through inlet and outlet passages (20a,20a`). A protection part (19a) made of relatively harder metal is provided to guard the thermal sensor body against cavitation.    A built in thermal expansion element (15a) expands or contracts with the rise and fall of temp. of engine cooling water and moves a diaphragm (15e) accordingly. The movement of the diaphragm causes a change in pressure of a fluid (15f) which gives movement to a rubber piston (15h) in a guiding cylinder (15g). The rubber piston pushes a piston (15c) which causes movement of a plunger (16) used to close the valve through push nuts (24,24`). When the temp. of cooling water decreases, the thermal element (15a) contracts and a return spring (22) along with a valve spring (23) move the push nuts downward to open the supplementary passage.    ADVANTAGE -   Improves engine start and cold running performance. Automatically closes bypass passage when engine temp. reaches normal operating level. Prevents cavitation of thermal sensor body by employing protection part.

A limiter (10) can be provided for the spring-lever system (3).    When cooling water temperature decreases below the upper limit, lever of the spring-lever system (3) is moved clockwise by a spring (9). At the lower temperature limit its end presses on the right-hand end of beam (6), which in turn presses on the microswitch (2), opening excitation circuit of main generator. Screw (10) prevents further movement of the beam (6).    When water temperature increases, lever (3) is rotated anticlockwise by the rod (12), and at the upper limit catches the left-hand end of beam (6) by the screw (7) head, opening the excitation circuit. When water temperature is between the limits, generator excitation circuit is closed and the diesel-electric locomotive can move. The microswitch operation is adjusted by screws (7, 8, 10).    Further items are a cylinder (15) with volatile liquid, placed in the cooling system, with connecting capillary tube (14), and sylphon bellows (11).

A biasing spring (50) is located within                the nozzle shield and operative to normally bias                the valve element to the closed position. The                nozzle shield is sized and configured such that the                located biasing spring is shielded from direct                impingement of cooling water flowing into the flow                passage.    USE - Nozzle assembly used for de-superheating                device or attemperator.    ADVANTAGE - Since the biasing spring is shielded from                direct impingement of cooling water flowing into                the flow passage, the cooling water can be                uniformly sprayed into the flow of superheated                steam. Hence the temperature of the steam can be                reduced. The nozzle assembly can be constructed                with relatively few components so that the                maintenance of the nozzle assembly can be reduced.                The occurrence of the thermal shock to prescribed                internal structural components can be prevented.                The level of thermal shocking of the biasing spring                can be reduced so that the occurrence of the spring                breakage can be reduced.

The roll operation life is increased by eliminating the additional connections between the barrel and the shaft since the roller is provided with pre-deformed springs (7) placed between the adjacent stops and bushes. The springs total deformation delta is equal to the barrel max. thermal expansion. The stops can longitudinally displace on the shaft.    The spring hardness C is determined from ((2.Q.f.n)/delta) is smaller than C is smaller or equal to ((rho.F)/(alpha.Tmax.l)), where Q is the roll barrel weight; f isthe friction coefficient between the stop, shaft and the barrel; delta is the spring deformation; rho is the barrel material creep limit at max. operation temp.; F is the barrel transverse cross section; alpha is the barrel material linear expansion coefficient; l is the distance between the adjacent stops and bushes. The stops surface (6), which contacts the shaft, is cylindrical.    USE -   The roll is used in furnaces.

An outflow port (22A) is positioned inside the buried pipe, and is provided with a warm water flow path (22) to make the warm water whose temperature is higher than that of geothermal heat to flow in buried pipe. A heat-collection pipe (20) of a heat pump apparatus (3) is accommodated in the inside of buried pipe such that a portion of heat-collection pipe is positioned in a warm water that flows into the buried pipe and is stored from warm water flow path.    USE - Pump system using geothermal heat as heat source of heat pump of heating system used in accommodation establishments such as house, hotel, and greenhouse for animal and plant.    ADVANTAGE - The hot spring flows out of outflow ports in the buried pipe and is provided with temperature higher than the storage hot spring so as to move upwards at the hot spring flowed out of the outflow ports in the storage hot spring so that the temperature in underground is reduced by thermal radiation to the degree air close to the ground surface such that the position of outflow ports is arranged in the deep position of underground. Thus, the tolerance with respect to the corrosion by hot spring of geothermal heat pump system is improved effectively by comprising the heatcollection pipe, buried pipe, and warm water inflow tube with material of high corrosion resistance. Hence, the fall of temperature of storage hot spring is suppressed effectively by decreasing the thermal radiation to underground of the hot spring flowed out into the storage hot spring while suppressing the expense of construction of excavation of well and the man-hour to bury the heat-collection pipe. Since the hot spring is stored by the buried pipe, the heat-collection pipe, buried pipe, and warm water inflow tube lies in the state immersed in the hot spring, the deviation toward alkalinity and corrosivity of hot spring is high. The opening portion of the upper end of buried pipe is sealed by the cover case so that the thermal radiation from the opening portion of the upper end of the buried pipe and the penetration of rain water is prevented. Thus, the temperature fall of storage hot spring is suppressed effectively.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of the heating system.

The barrier has insulative stop and seat                components interengaged for thermally isolating the                liquid on one side of the barrier from the liquid                on the other side when the liquid within the line                is stagnant. The barrier automatically opens to                permit liquid flow through the line and closes to                thermally isolate the liquid when the flow is                interrupted. Thus the liquid flow within the line                is unimpeded by the thermal barrier.    For an application in which the line is                subjected to low temperature which could freeze                trapped liquid (such as in the outlet line of a                water heater located in an uninsulated space), a                small bypass passage is provided which is open when                the barrier stop is closed so that a limited amount                of heat is conducted past the barrier to deter                freezing of the water.

A cooling unit is arranged around the pipe to convert hot-spring steam into hot water. The hot water is discharged through a discharge pipe system (4). A surplus hot spring steam discharge pipe system (5) is provided for discharging the remaining hot steam as surplus hot steam.    USE - System for use in e.g. producing electric power and hot water from the steam of a hot spring. Can also be used in geothermal power generation and electric power generation using surplus heat of steam turbine piping system.    ADVANTAGE - The electric power generation function and hot-water making function are implemented collectively by effectively using hot spring steam. The electric power and hot water production system has a simple structure by avoiding the use of electric motor and electric pump. Several cooling fans are driven by using the generated electric power in order to improve cooling effect, electric power generation capability, and hot water production efficiency. The increase of electric power generation amount and hot water production amount is possible by connecting several electric power generation and hot-water making units in series or parallel. The storage of hot water and consumption of surplus hot spring steam are possible by providing the storage tank and hot spring steam consumption load. The thermal insulation board prevents the reduction of cooling capability of cooling unit due to heating by sunlight. The thermal insulation board ensures straightening of airflow from the fan of cooling tower and prevents the generation of noise due to the rotation of fan. The electric power supply is stabilized by controlling the temperature of inside and outside of thermoelectric conversion and cooling unit.

Efficiency and processing speeds are improved by introducing an evaporation chamber mounted above the reflectors and connected to the cavity formed between the reflectors and transport conveyor, together with a water tank installed above the evaporation chamber and furnished with a means of regulating the supply of water to the chamber. This takes the form of a tube with a spring-loaded solenoid-operated piston capable of closing the nozzle that releases water from the tank.    When the IR heater and the evaporator have warmed up, the control unit starts the fixing process by energising solenoid (11), which lifts steel core (10) and opens nozzle (8) to release water into the evaporation chamber. The water evaporates and passes through the hole in the reflectors into the fixing zone, so that a hot mixture of steam and air acts on the copy paper. The steam formation is stopped by removing the voltage on solen-i (11), allowing spring (12) to return the core to the top of the tube.    USE -   For fixing images developed by the action of heat on thermoplastic powdered developer.

The tray is withdrawable horizontally. The water cooled heatsink (8), one for each tray, is built into the cubicle which carries the trays. The heatsink has a flat heat exchanging surface (9) which is brought into intimate contact with the corresponding surface (5) on the mounting plate (2). Springs (10) in the heatsink assembly provide the necessary contact pressure.    A mechanical linkage (12-15) operates a cam (12) which presses the heatsink (8) down against the force of the springs (10) to make a gap (a) between the two heat transfer surfaces (5,9). The tray (1) can then be removed complete for repair or replacement.    ADVANTAGE -   Not necessary to disconnect cooling water system in order to remove or replace tray. 		   (US4733720-A)      The water cooling arrangement, the carrier element on which the component parts are arranged is fashioned as a component parts carrier independent of the cooling member. A water-traversed cooling member which is seated essentially apparatus-rigid can be individually brought into thermal interaction with every component parts carrier inserted into the device in the composite of an insert.    The insert is brought into thermal interaction with the carrier by the force of resilient elements at heat transmission surfaces precisely mating to one another which are fashioned at component parts carriers and cooling members. With a mechanical device, all cooling members can be distanced in common from the apertaining component parts carriers opposite the acting direction of the forces of the resilient elements.    USE/ADVANTAGE -   For insertable component parts groups in devices of power electronics. Replacement of component parts carriers is enabled without performing manipulations at devices of cooling water circulation, fast, avoids static ambiguity, corresponds to given space conditions.

A thermal valve is mounted in the inlet to the auxiliary coil pipe and is connected to the water mains. The valve is a twin-saddle valve consisting of a support unit (8), return mechanism (10) and an elasticated bellows device (14).    The bellows separates the valve body into transfer (15) and sealing (16) chambers. Within the sealing chamber there is a permanent magnet (17) fixed at one end to the support unit and also a heat-sensing element (18) made from a material with a Curie point equal to the overheating point of the pump.    The thermal valve is operated by the force of the permanent magnet. The support unit (8) is held in the open position by the force of the magnetic field in conjunction with the heat sensing element. When the pump overheats, the magnet loses its magnetism and the support unit springs back under the force of the spring. This action allows water to be fed to the coil-pipe to cool the unit down. When the temperature falls below the Curie point, the cycle repeats itself.    ADVANTAGE -   Increase in reliability, more economical and easier to use.

A first support (4) is located at the upper side of a frame (3) to support the thermal-insulation body. A second support (5) is located at the lower side of frame to support the mat-form member.    USE - Cooler tool for installing in e.g. rooftop, triangular roof of building to suppress temperature rise of target object e.g. outdoor unit of air conditioning machine exposed in sunlight.    ADVANTAGE - Ensures heat that gets across to mat-form member by air space formed between thermal-insulation body and mat-form member is blocked effectively while shielding the sunrays that reach cooling object surface and mat-form member by positioning the thermal-insulation body for light-shielding sunrays above the mat-form member. Suppresses temperature rise of cooling object surface by giving cooling effect through vaporization of heat of the mat-form member to cooling object surface, thus provides useful cooler tool with simple structure. Reduces frequency of operation in supplying water to the mat-form member since rain water is supplied to mat-form member through the thermal-insulation body having water permeability and air permeability. Promotes cooling of the cooling object surface since water contained in the mat-form member is evaporated efficiently by applying wind to mat-form member from upper direction through the thermal-insulation body. Ensures easy and rapid installation of cooler tool only by fixing the frame to installation location. Suppresses increase of cooler tool by positioning the thermal-insulation body to overlap with respect to the mat-form member. Ensures thermal-insulation body is reliably supported to the first support by providing the thermal-insulation body in stretched state by the coil spring.

The water seeps into the lower layers of snow, forming a layer (2) of slush, which freezes on top, on the surface of the ice. Thus an upper layer (3) of ice under snow (4) is formed, separated from the basic ice layer (1) by a layer of snow (2) saturated with water which acts as a thermal insulation layer, so that all winter the layer of ice is at a temperature of 0 degrees centigrade.    This ice covering in layers has low thermal conductivity, is easily broken up in spring and does not present a risk to hydrotechnical constructions. Ice in layers is encountered under natural conditions.    In each individual case, to create a layered structure of ice the thickness of the water layer should be determined so as to assure that the layers (1,3) of ice are kept separate throughout the winter.

 ANDREWS D J;  MICHAEL A D	DELTA MEMORY METAL LTD (DELT-Non-standard)	1983834940	      The electric immersion heater unit incorporates a temp. sensitive element which opens a switch to disconnect the electric heating element when the element reaches an excessive temp. A manually operated resetting member (27) is mounted in the vicinity of the electric power terminals of the unit so that when a power supply plug is mated with the power terminals the resetting member resets the switch to a closed condition.    The temp. sensitive element is an shape memory effect spring which when heated moves a button to open the switch contacts. An over centre spring keeps the contacts opn until the resetting member is operated. Resetting is effected by removing the plug to allow the resetting member to spring outwardly and then reattaching the plug to return the resetting member to cause lugs (32) to displace the button so that the over centre spring is returned to maintain the contacts closed. The immersion heater is thus reset during the operation of refilling the kettle with water.

The safety mechanism is designed for simplicity by having a thermal insulation lining (2) in between the cylinder block wall and the casing, and the casing equipped with a sealing membrane (4). The spring-loaded valve is in the form of a stopper (9) which fits in a central socket (8) in channel (7) and is in contact with the membrane.    In the event of the cooling system water temperature dropping to near freezing point, the water in the side channels freezes and this leads to an increase in the pressure in the inner chamber of the housing, and this pushes out the membrane, assisted by the spring-loaded plug, so the cooling water can drain out of the system.

The bellows is heated both by the hot water supplying the radiators and an electric heating element placed in the bellows fluid.    The electric heating element is supplied through the temp. setting thermostat, a room temp. transducer, or a combination of both. The heating effect of the element on the bellows fluid is additional to that of the circulating water. As the bellows heat and expands, an attached rod pushes a lever, which reduces the air flow to the combustion. As the bellows cool and contract a spring forces the lever to remain in contact with the bellows so opening the air damper.

The glasses of the piston and cylinder possess the same coefficient of thermal expansion. The graduation marks of the scale are 25 mm long and 0.5 mm wide to give no-parallelex reading along an imaginary line to the axis of the piston. The whole unit can be pivoted upside down, to permit removal of air from the bottom chamber. Each element of the filtration and water separation plant is connected through a pipe to a coordinator and the precision pressure gauge. Readings to plus-or-minus 0.05% of the differential pressure at 20 degrees C are obtained. The weak spring provides the high accuracy in the low-pressure range.

A sealing ring (23) has an active                position when the strips are in the hot position,                where the ring has an inactivated position when the                strips are in the cold position. A                locking/unlocking unit (25) is designed to lock the                ring in the inactivated position when the strips                are in the cold position, and to free the ring when                the strips are in the hot position. An elastic unit                (24) i.e. compression spring, urges the ring into                the activated position when the locking/unlocking                unit is unlocked.    USE - Water-proofing system for passive connection                of joints of a shaft of a primary motorized pump                unit (claimed) in a nuclear reactor.    ADVANTAGE - The elastic unit urges the ring into the                activated position when the locking/unlocking unit                is unlocked, thus ensuring activation of the                water-proofing system with good performance at the                time of accident situation or station black-out                situation. The system stops a leak of primary                coolant circuit that results from failure of joints                of the pump unit without the need for an auxiliary                activation source. The system has a simplified                architecture.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a                primary motorized pump unit.

It differs in that the valve opening rate is                reduced, beyond an intermediate temperature of                between 130 and 150 degrees C, by a stabiliser (18)                that opposes the force generated by the thermally                deformable element. The stabiliser is in the form                of a spring pin that acts on a valve component of                the thermally-deformable element.    USE - Steam iron with controlled water flow to                vaporizing chamber.    ADVANTAGE - Automatic regulation of steam output that is                less sensitive to manufacturing and assembly                tolerances, and assuring a more constant steam                output from one iron to another at a given sole                temperature.

Heat from the hot water                tank is circulated in form of hot water to the heat                exchanger (6) in a passive stack (4). Heat is                exchanged into the exhausting air in the stack,                increasing airflow (7) through the stack. The use                of heat from the solar panel is controlled based on                whether or not there is excess of heat contained in                the water tank.

The samples to be tested are in each case located in a water filled transparent body so as to divide the body in two. Thickness change is measured by applying the same liquid pressure to both sides of a sample and measuring the movement of a piston lightly spring-biassed against one side whilst thermal conductance is measured by locating a heater between a pair of specimens sandwiched between equal pressure cooling chambers. At a steady state the conductance can be calculated from the input of the heater. Stretch-flex characteristics are measured by applying an overpressure to one side of a singee specimen sheet to bulge it and by measuring the movement of a rod placed against the centre point of the sheet. In this way the properties of materials for possible use in deep sea diving can be evaluated.

For more rapid action below 0 deg.C., the heat-sensitive element is in the form of two coaxial sylphons bellows. The cavity of the smaller sylphon is connected to atmosphere.    In normal thermal regime, spring (18) presses lock (7) to set (11). With air consumers switched off and at minus temps., inner sylphons bellows (6) is cooled via outlet (14) and windows (15). The water in heat-sensitive element (8) freezes. As the volume of water expands, sylphon bellows (5 & 6) expand. Lock (7) comes down, covering aperture (20). The condensate is removed by air pressure to atmosphere via cavity (12), aperture (13) and outlet (14), till the heat of the air melts the ice. Spring (18) then presses the lock back against the seat. Condensate in chamber (12) is drained ia aperture (20).
