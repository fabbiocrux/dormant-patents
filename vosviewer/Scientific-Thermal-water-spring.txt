Conductive cooling of the thermal waters along the flow path is the likely cause for the difference between the observed spring temperatures and the source temperature inferred from chemical geothermometry. Conductive cooling alone can not easily account for the seasonal fluctuations in spring temperatures, however. Mixing of the thermal waters with cold meteoric waters would seem a likely possibility; but thermal water chemistry is constant, indicating that mixing does not occur after the water leaves the zone of heating. Even if mixing occurred, simple mixing models do not account totally for the observed temperature differences of the springs from late spring to summer. The geochemical and thermal data argue for a complex hydrological and thermal regime.

Mixing processes between thermal waters and non-thermal waters: a case study in Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Thermal waters; Non-thermal waters; Mixing processes; Minor elements (As; Fe; Mn; B; and Li)	GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; LOS-AZUFRES; SPRINGS; GROUNDWATER; ORIGIN; REGION; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; HYDROCHEMISTRY; CONTAMINATION; GEOCHEMISTRY	The high content of toxic elements, such as As, in thermal water can cause water-quality problems when thermal water mixes with groundwater and/or surface water destined for human consumption. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mixing process between thermal and non-thermal waters in the Ixtapan de la Sal-Tonatico region of Mexico and to determine the resulting impacts on the quality of water for human consumption. The thermal springs of the study area had an average temperature of 35 degrees C and 5g/L of total dissolved solids (TDS). The dominant ions were Cl- and Na+. The concentrations of As (1.7mg/L), Fe (2.2mg/L), and Mn (0.15mg/L) and the water hardness (2087mg CaCO3/L) exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water. Non-thermal springs, well water, and surface water were characterized as Ca-Na-Cl-HCO3, Ca-Mg-HCO3, and Na-Ca-Cl types, respectively, and had TDS values of 0.8, 0.2, and 0.4-3.9g/L, respectively. The percentages of mixing were calculated based on the concentrations of conservative ions, such as Cl, B, Sr, and Li. The percentage of thermal water spring mixed with non-thermal spring water was around 11% and with surface water ranged from 10 to 30%. This variability is likely related to the proximity of surface water sources to the discharge points of thermal springs. As a result of mixing processes, the non-thermal water (non-thermal springs and surface waters) presents TDS, Cl-, Na+, hardness, As, Fe, and Mn values above those permitted by Mexican regulations for drinking water.

The groundwater at the thermal springs has low values of total dissolved solids, and its main water types are Na-HCO3. The thermal springs are mainly recharged from meteoric precipitations. The recharge areas are located near the springs at an approximate elevation of 1,800 m. The groundwater of the thermal springs is immature and partially equilibrated with a strong mixture of the shallow cold waters during the flow process. The shallow cold water accounts for more than 90 %. The temperatures of thermal reservoir that feed the springs are between 146 and 260 A degrees C, and the calculated groundwater circulation depths range from 2,000 to 5,700 m below ground surface.

At the same time, thermal spring areas are one of the best habitats for algae among aquatic habitats. If algae formed on the surface of the thermal water in these areas, they create an ugly appearance and disrupt the aesthetics of the water because of their uncontrolled growth. The algae removal applications are the most effective methods for solution of these adversities in the thermal spring areas. In this work, experimental study was carried out to investigate the removal of algae from thermal water and thermal mud pools in the Delicermic-Koprukoy (Erzurum, NE Turkey) thermal spring area. For this purpose, some chemical materials were used for the removal of algae. The results of the experimental studies showed that the Al2SO3+CaO solution is a good material that provides 100% removal of algae from thermal water and thermal mud pools at pH 6.

Groundwater and spring water samples were collected in May and September 2012 and analyzed for major parameters, anions, cations, and potentially toxic elements. Groundwater is the local source of drinking water and along with cold springs is used for agricultural irrigation. Thermal springs are mainly used for bathing and balneological purposes. For both wells and springs under study, boron was found to have the higher concentration than the specifications in WHO standards except for PF spring. Arsenic, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Ni in thermal springs and most of groundwater samples and cold springs indicate higher concentration than those of WHO standard. The low Na/Ca and Na/K ratios in STS and TTS thermal springs confirm these waters associated with up-flow zones, while higher Na/K ratios for cold springs reveal effects of lateral flows. Conservative elements indicate that thermal springs fall within the hydrothermal field, indicating magmatic affiliation of the thermal waters. High concentrations of trace elements and major ions in well water, thermal springs, and acidic cold springs provide evidences for water-rock interaction processes and the presence of active deep circulations. Saturation indices (SI) show that thermal waters are oversaturated with respect to quartz, chalcedony, alunite, gypsum, celestite, and barite, evident by precipitation of sulfate and siliceous minerals in the most recent precipitates of the geothermal system. The cold springs and groundwater are oversaturated with chalcedony, quartz, hematite (four water wells), and goethite (two water wells), slightly highlighting the mixing of the groundwater with thermal and acidic springs. The SI indicates that the Fe-phase minerals could control mobility of As in the groundwater of the Taftan area. The present study is addressing a significant risk of toxic elements in groundwater resource management, in the volcanic regions in the southeast of Iran, and suggests some preventive measures for controlling adverse effects of using such waters for drinking and irrigation.

The H2S effects of thermal waters treatments have long been studied, for dermatological and clinical treatments, but its role in recreational waters was never investigated. The use of sulfur spring waters in pools raises concerns related to disinfection by oxidants. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival rate of microbial species in waters with different titers of H2S. Four selected thermal waters collected from Italian springs, belonging to different chemical categories, have been tested in comparison to Tyrrhenian sea water and natural mineral bottled water. Results show inhibition properties on bacterial proliferation that seem related to H2S concentrations. To further asses this phenomenon H2S was added to thermal and natural mineral waters. The results strongly support a bactericidal role of H2S in thermal spring waters used for recreational purposes. These observations open up new perspectives for a disinfectant role of H2S in pool treatment and management. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermal springs had relatively higher temperatures and dissolved ion contents than non-thermal springs and wells, and were classified as water chemistry type of HCO3-Na + K. The reservoir temperatures were determined with their chemical compositions, and 131.0 to 138.9 degrees C estimated by a quartz geothermometer after steam loss were regarded as the most suitable assessment. Inadequate equilibrium between water and rock interaction is mostly speculated and the mixing with shallow non-thermal groundwater probably has minor contribution to the thermal springs. Stable isotope compositions of thermal springs ranged from -45.1 parts per thousand. to -40.8 parts per thousand. for 5D and from -72%. to -6.9 parts per thousand for delta O-18, respectively. These isotopic results were almost identical to those of non-thermal springs. All the thermal and non-thermal groundwater samples scattered around the meteoric water lines, thus indicating meteoric water origin without further influences of evaporation and groundwater-rock interaction. The similarity of thermal and non-thermal groundwater in chemical and isotopic compositions suggested that groundwater migrating and being heated very quickly in a relatively fast conductive fracture system hosted by deep-seated faults mostly represented the mechanism of thermal springs.

Geochemical evaluation of thermal springs in Odisha, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Thermal spring mixing; Hydrochemistry; Temporal and spatial variation of thermal waters	WATERS; TURKEY; AREA; HYDROCHEMISTRY; GROUNDWATER; EVOLUTION; BASIN; STATE; FIELD	The Indian state of Odisha has a number of thermal springs. These thermal springs are located at eight places (Attri, Tarabalo, Deulajhari, Magarmuhan, Bankhol, Badaberena, Taptapani and Boden) and belong to Mahanadi Geothermal Province, which is an Archean/Pre-Cambrian Geothermal Province. The thermal water discharging from these springs shows moderately acidic to moderately alkaline character (pH: 5.058.93) and the temperature ranges from 28 (Boden) to 58 degrees C (Tarabalo). Total dissolved solids (TDS) also shows a wide variation between 16.9 (Bankhol) and 595 mg/L (Deulajhari). A wide variation in the chemical characteristics of the thermal waters has been observed as they are located in different geological settings. Based on water chemistry, all the thermal springs can broadly be grouped into three water types: Na-Cl, Ca-HCO3 and Na-HCO3. The thermal spring water from Attri, Tarabalo and Deulajhari belongs to Na-Cl water type which is due to the circulation through granitic rocks. Higher concentrations of Cl and F in these thermal waters further suggest limited mixing and longer residence time as compared to the other areas where Ca-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 water types were found. Anion variation diagram clearly indicates that the thermal waters from Attri, Tarabalo and Deulajhari are fast ascending and fall in the mature water field; thus, their chemical signatures can be used to determine the reservoir temperature. However, in other areas, water chemistry is shaped by near-surface groundwater mixing processes and thus the chemical geothermometers may not be applicable to determine the reservoir temperature. No appreciable temporal variations have been observed in the water chemistry of the thermal waters.	[Zimik, Horthing V.; Farooq, S.

Thermal and chemical characteristics of hot water springs in the northern part of the Limpopo Province, South Africa	WATER SA			English	Article						thermal springs; South Africa; macro and micro-elements; geological controls	GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; WORLD	In many countries thermal springs are utilised for a variety of purposes, such as the generation of power, direct space heating, industrial processes, aquaculture and many more. The optimal use of a thermal spring is largely dependent upon its physical and chemical characteristics. This article focuses on the thermal and chemical features of 8 thermal springs located in the northern part of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Field data and water samples were collected from Evangelina, Tshipise, Sagole, Moreson, Siloam, Mphephu, Minwamadi and Die Eiland for analysis of physical and chemical parameters. The temperatures at source vary from 30 degrees C to 67.5 degrees C. The springs are associated with faults and impermeable dykes and are assumed to be of meteoric origin. The mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations found at the depth of origin. None of the spring waters are fit for human consumption since they contain unacceptably high levels of bromide ions. Six springs do not conform to domestic water quality guidelines with respect to fluoride levels. Unacceptably high values of mercury were detected at Moreson and Die Eiland. Spring water at Evangelina is contaminated with selenium and arsenic. It is important to keep such limitations in mind when determining the ultimate use of the thermal springs.

The aim is to elucidate the provenance and evolution of thermal spring water, further to reveal geological information on the deep basin. Analysis results show that the spring waters are rich in K and Ca but deficient in Mg and Br. Most spring water samples have TDS within the range of 10-100 g/L, with a few containing 1-10 g/L TDS, and can be referred to as saline springs. High consistency of spring water data with seawater curves indicates that Na and Cl in spring water are derived from residual seawater sequestered in strata, or dissolution of self-evaporiting salts in strata. However, the mean Cl/Br value of spring water samples ranges from 1000 to 30,000, further indicating that solutes in spring water are derived from dissolved evaporites (e.g., NaCl) in strata. Sulfur isotopic characteristics indicate that thermal spring waters commonly dissolve Jurassic gypsum in strata and dolomitization of calcite is the mainly reason for Mg loss. The interpretation of Ca enrichment of spring waters of northwest Wan'an Lake (NWA), Yuanquan River (YQR), and east Thermal Spring (ETS) include: dissolution of gypsum and albitization of plagioclase. Spring waters of south Dogai Coring Lake (SDC) are enriched with more Ca than that at the NWA, YQR and east ETS, mainly due to dissolution of gypsum and dolomitization of calcite. The enrichment of K of spring waters at NWA, YQR and ETS can be attributed to albitization and dissolution of K-feldspar in groundwater. Relatively increased K in SDC spring waters are possibly derived from dissolution of potassium minerals (e.g., KCl). The 2nd member of Xiali Formation has 87Sr/86Sr values distributed in a consistent range with those of thermal spring waters in the Dogai Coring area, which is most likely the source horizon of salts (e.g., halite, gypsum, and sylvine). Modern meteoric water enter strata and dissolve ancient evaporites.

To study the hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry, sixteen water samples were collected from the thermal and cold springs. Temperature of the cold springs range from 28.1 to 36.6 degrees C while mean temperature of the thermal spring waters is similar to 42 degrees C. Generally, the salinity values of the water samples vary from 1102 in the cold spring to 10250 mu S/cm in the thermal springs. The water samples are categorized into three types: Cl-Na, Cl-HCO3-Na-and SO4-Na. The composition values of delta H-2 and delta O-18 in the thermal springs were resulted from water-rock interaction or underground evaporation in the deep depths. Since the thermal springs have a different temperatures but similar chloride content, it seems that a conductive cooling mechanism is occurring in the geothermal system. Based on the geothermometry results, the equilibrium temperature of the deep reservoir estimated from similar to 120 to 145 degrees C. The fraction of the cold water mixed with the warm water ascending is estimated to be similar to 0.94. Finally, the depth of thermal water circulation is estimated to ranging from 1.9 to 3 km under two different scenarios.

This region hosts four Quaternary volcanic areas, and thermal springs and gas emissions occur in three of them. Most thermal springs discharge Na-Cl composition waters of connate origin derived from post-orogenic volcanic and sedimentary formations. Although high-enthalpy systems are present in two of the four volcanic areas, there appear to be no magmatic contributions to the thermal springs. Solute geothermometers are unreliable as spring waters are strongly affected by mixing with ''shallow'' brines before discharging. Thermal springs and gas emissions also occur in non-volcanic areas, where an extensive carbonate unit acts as a regional aquifer for cold, low-salinity, bicarbonate waters. Thermal features in these areas occur in fractured zones associated with active faults. Their compositions:are determined only by the type of rock encountered by solutions before surface discharge. As in other areas of north-central Italy, the widespread occurrence of hot and cold CO2-rich springs, and gas emissions in both volcanic and non-volcanic zones, suggests a deep origin for the CO2.

The issuing temperatures of the thermal waters vary from 31 degrees to 89 degrees C for the thermal springs and 24 degrees to 25 degrees C for the cold springs. These thermal springs are located on the Archean Chotanagpur Gneissic Complex (CGC) in the eastern part of peninsular India. The thermal springs are mostly alkaline in nature with pH varying from 7.5 to 9.5. Piper diagram suggests that the chemistry of the thermal waters is compatible with the granitic host rocks through which the waters circulate. Mineral saturation index suggests that the thermal waters are saturated with cristobalite and quartz at lower temperatures (less than similar to 130 degrees to 150 degrees C), and calcite and forsterite at higher temperatures (similar to 160 degrees to 250 degrees C). The estimated reservoir temperature based on chemical geothermometers is in the range of 132 degrees-265 degrees C, which favours a medium enthalpy geothermal system. Oxygen isotope fractionation of Bakreswar and Tantloi thermal springs highlights a higher reservoir temperature than estimated by chemical geothermometer. Positive gravity anomalies over Bakreswar and Tantloi areas strongly suggest a basement/mantle upliftment or mafic intrusion which could account for the heat source close to the surface. However, the large negative gravity anomaly depression around the Surajkund and Katkamsandi thermal springs indicates presence of deep seated faults.

A major component in 13 spring water samples was analyzed using various techniques. The waters of the thermal springs at Guelma basin vary in temperature between 20 and 94 degrees C. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis suggests three groups. The water springs were classified as low, moderate and high salinity. Mineral saturation indices (SI) calculated from major ions indicate the spring waters are supersaturated with the most of the carbonate minerals, and all of the spring water samples are under-saturated with evaporite minerals. The thermal spring waters have a meteoric origin, and all samples are immature with strong mixing between warm and shallow waters, where the temperatures of reservoirs to which the thermal waters are related ranged between 64 degrees and 124 degrees C. The deep circulation of meteoric waters in the study area is supplied by the high geothermal gradient around 4.5 degrees C per 100 m and reaches a high temperature before rising to the surface. The estimated circulation depths ranged from 1425 and 3542 m.

For the exploration of geothermal resources, this study uses quartz and cation geothermometer to estimate the temperatures of the geothermal reservoir and uses the tubular models to evaluate the thermal gradient. The hydrogeochemical characteristics of the geothermal resources were also evaluated by hydrogeochemical analysis. The results showed that the geothermal reservoir temperatures of the four major thermal springs in Changbai Mountain region range from 72 to 169 degrees C. The average geothermal reservoir temperatures of Jinjiang hot springs, Changbai hot springs I, Xianrenqiao hot springs, and Changbai hot springs II are 129.25, 169, 89, and 73.67 degrees C, respectively. The geothermal gradient values of the four major thermal springs have different characteristics. The geothermal gradient values of Jinjiang hot springs and Changbai hot springs I are 4.6 and 3.1 degrees C/100 m, respectively. The geothermal gradient values of Xianrenqiao thermal springs and Changbai thermal springs II are both lower than 1.5 degrees C/100 m, with the values of 1.1 and 1.4 degrees C/100 m. And the geothermal gradients are influenced by Changbai Mountain Tianchi volcano. In addition, the water chemical analyses showed that the geothermal water types are HCO3-Na with higher concentrations of Na+, Cl-, SO42-, TDS, and HCO3- than the non-thermal waters, which suggested a deep and long water cycle of the thermal water, and therefore a sufficient water-rock interaction.

Stable isotopes study on geothermal waters in eastern India	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Geothermal water; meteoric water; stable isotope	BAKRESWAR	An experimental study on stable-isotopes (delta D, delta O-18) of thermal waters as well as non-thermal waters, from different geothermal springs in the Ganga-Mahanadi basin is reported. A total of 38 water samples were collected during September 2010 and analysed by elemental analyser followed by stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The isotopic composition for oxygen indicates that the water rock interaction is insignificant for the springs in the study area whereas the delta D values indicate blending between thermal and non-thermal waters. The results reveal that the origins of the thermal spring waters are primarily meteoric origin.	[Kumar, Pradeep; Das, Nisith K.; Mallik, C.; Bhandari, R.

Physical and chemical characteristics of thermal springs in the Waterberg area in Limpopo Province, South Africa	WATER SA			English	Article						thermal springs; Limpopo Province; water temperature; chemical composition; trace elements	MINERAL WATERS; GEOCHEMISTRY; WORLD	The Limpopo Province in South Africa is richly endowed with thermal springs. Some have been developed for recreational, tourism or other purposes, while a number remain completely undeveloped. If the full economic potential of springs can be realised in a sustainable manner, they could make a substantial contribution to the local or even regional economy. The optimal use of a thermal spring is largely dependent upon its physical and chemical characteristics. This article focuses on the temperature and chemical features of 8 selected thermal springs located in the southern (Waterberg) region of the Limpopo Province, namely Warmbaths, Loubad, Vischgat, Die Oog, Rhemardo, Lekkerrus, Libertas and Buffelshoek. All of these springs are of meteoric origin, with water temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 52 degrees C. The mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations found at the depth of origin. Changes in land use that occurred over the past few decades have apparently had no impact on the physical and chemical properties of the thermal spring waters. This effect may, however, become evident at a later stage due to a time tag in the migration of contaminants. The fluoride concentration of water from seven of the eight springs (all except Loubad) does not conform to domestic water quality guidelines and makes the water unfit for human consumption. Unacceptably high values of mercury were detected at Libertas. It is recommended that strict monitoring of the concentration of fluoride and other potentially harmful elements should be mandatory whenever the thermal spring water is used for bottling, domestic or full-contact recreational purposes.

The hydrogeochemical characteristics and reservoir temperatures of the nine thermal springs and fifteen cold springs were evaluated by hydrogeochemical analysis, statistical analysis and geothermometry analysis. The results showed that the concentrations of ions of thermal springs were higher than those of cold springs. HCO3- and Na+ were the most abundant anion and cation in the thermal springs, and hydrochemical type was Na-HCO3. While the cold springs were enriched in Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3- and SO42-, and hydrochemical types were Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 center dot SO4, Ca-HCO3(,) Ca center dot Mg center dot Na-HCO3 and Ca center dot Mg center dot Na-SO4 center dot HCO3. The age of thermal springs were larger than 62 years. Olivine and pyroxene were under-saturated for all thermal springs; and olivine, pyroxene, dolomite and fluorite were under-saturated for all cold springs. All the thermal and cold springs samples can be divided into three groups by cluster test, and all the thermal spring samples fell into the part of immature waters, the mixing ration of cold and hot water ranged 12.70 to 36.95%. The reservoir temperatures of WQ1 to WQ9 were between 96.88 and 174.28 degrees C using silica geothermometry.

Romano			Microflora Thermarum Atlas project: biodiversity in thermal spring waters and natural SPA pools	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						biodiversity; mfDNA; metagenomic; geochemistry; SPA; thermal spring waters	COMMUNITIES	Thermal springs are natural environments present all over the world and their use represents a social-economical resource with an impact on sanus per aquam (SPA) medical and wellness applications. Physical-chemical and microbiological balances characterize these ecological niches and their knowledge is essential to define water properties and support appropriate management. This study is a pilot application of a larger research project, involving metagenomics and aimed to fingerprint springs and map SPA biodiversity. Waters and their deposits were collected in six thermal springs from the Lazio region in Italy. The phylogenic microbial profiles performed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis showed a clear separation between different springs. Statistical analyses revealed correlations between the abundance of specific bacteria and environmental variables. Temperature, Sodium and H2S levels appear to play a key role in influencing the microbiota. The extension of this model to other springs will contribute to characterize and map the microbial community in thermal springs, allowing associations with chemical-physical factors. Biodiversity is a still underestimated property of thermal springs and a key element in several SPA applications. The Atlas progress is shedding light on biotic and abiotic components in these ecological niches, opening further perspectives for supporting appropriate use and management of thermal waters.

Both non-thermal and thermal waters undergo seasonal isotopic variations, being enriched in O-18 and D in the winter relative to the rainy season. For non-thermal waters, this is due to a higher rate of evaporation in winter as a consequence of depleting atmospheric humidity; the effect is more pronounced for surface waters than groundwaters. The degree of variation is, in general, very low for thermal waters. The difference in issuing temperature, as well as small variations in the stable isotopic composition and tritium content of the springs, are suggestive of very low to moderate dilution of thermal waters by nearby shallow groundwater. Agnikund, the hottest spring (71 degrees C), is least diluted (10%) by local non-thermal waters and hence is the best representative of deep-seated thermal water. The presence of very low amounts of tritium (0.6 +/- 0.5 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 TU) in thermal waters indicates their long subsurface circulation time (> 50 years). Similar delta O-18 and delta D values for Bakreswar and Tantloi spring waters point to their origin from the same meteoric water and therefore they are genetically related. Recharge of the springs is likely to take place somewhere in the vicinity of Gondwana basins occurring along the central part of the Chotanagpur plateau. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal springs are of Na-Cl-SO4 type and are rich in SiO2 and F, contrary to the local groundwaters which are mostly of Ca-HCO3 type. The springs undergo mild to moderate dilution by local groundwater, which does not significantly affect their original compositions. Agnikund, the main spring, with the highest temperature, mild dilution, consistent composition and negligible tritium, discharges almost pure deep-seated thermal water. Original thermal water is at equilibrium with quartz in the deep reservoir and, attains surface temperature largely by conductive cooling with no significant loss of dissolved SiO2. Certain ionic ratios coupled with very low tritium contents in the springs are indicative of prolonged subsurface circulation of the original water. XRD results of the spring site sediments and the bore hole rocks fairly corroborate the predicted saturation state of thermal water with respect to quartz, feldspar, calcite, fluorite etc., which is believed to control the major chemical compositions of the springs. A geothermal reservoir having probable temperature of about 100 +/- 5 degrees C and possibly occurring at a depth of 1 km is the source of thermal water for the springs. The present study is aimed at understanding the mixing trend between thermal springs and local groundwaters as well as the water-rock equilibria. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of water temperature over benthic diatom communities: insights from thermal springs	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY			English	Article						Biodiversity; eukaryotic algae; Iberian Peninsula; rivers; temperature preferences	HOT-SPRINGS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEW-ZEALAND; SYSTEMS; ECOSYSTEMS; BACTERIA; STREAMS; FLORAS; PLANTS; ALGAE	Background Thermal springs provide extreme ecological conditions for aquatic communities owing to their high water temperature and particular water chemistry. The thermal springs and their connected watercourses provide a thermal laboratory by offering a wide range of temperatures within short spatial distances. To date, the information on how the biodiversity of these springs is related to water temperature or chemistry is limited. Aims We studied the effects of water temperature on diatom community diversity and structure with the objective to supply a baseline for the conservation of thermal springs. Methods We sampled 31 sites of 16 thermal springs across a temperature gradient between 18.5 and 63.0 degrees C in the north-western Iberian Peninsula and related diatom richness and structure to water temperature. Results A total of 124 diatom species were identified in springs with water temperature between 18.5 and 42.4 degrees C. Community diversity decreased with increasing temperature and the highest species richness was found at temperatures <= 25 degrees C. Three diatom assemblages were defined, discriminated by temperature ranges (<= 25 degrees C, 25-35 degrees C and >= 35 degrees C). Conclusions Water temperature was found to be an important driver of diatom community composition in the thermal systems studied. Temperature affects diatom distribution decreasing diversity with the increase in global water temperature.	[Delgado, Cristina; Almeida, Salome F.

This reserve comes from rainwater infiltrated into rocks and sediments to give rise to mineralized waters feeding many springs and having curative properties, which confer each spa-specific therapeutic indications, based on the medicinal properties of its waters. All over the world, mineral waters of thermal springs have interesting therapeutic uses to cure some diseases; unfortunately, such potential is underexploited in Morocco. This narrative review deals with the distribution of thermal springs in Morocco, the classification of their thermal waters, and their health effects, with the aim to enhance them. For this purpose, previous studies' results on different aspects of thermal waters were searched in the most famous scientific databases, by using targeted specific keywords. Literature has shown that Morocco contains several thermal springs, scattered throughout the Middle Atlas, in the South, and in the Rif, which are regarded as waters of high therapeutic quality, whose thermal cures are often recommended to people suffering from rheumatism and locomotor system's diseases, skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, or respiratory troubles. However, apart from the unique and real thermal station of Moulay Yacoub, the other thermal springs are exploited in an empirical and artisanal way, mainly by a local population. So, as hydrotherapy constitutes a good choice of natural therapy using water components as a complement or alternative to conventional treatments, a better understanding of the thermal springs' distribution in Morocco, their thermal waters' classification, and their potential health effects may enable their valorization through a better use of their waters.

The seven thermal springs were investigated in respect of geological, hydrological and chemical characteristics. The springs are confined to the crystalline schists and gneissic terrains of Precambrian age. The common characteristics of thermal spring water are its alkaline nature (pH - 7.4 to 7.8), moderate to low TDS (0.16 to 0.52 gm/l). Important constituents are Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, SO4, CO3 and HCO3. The gases associated with the hot water are N-2, minor He, O-2, Ar-2, CO2 & traces of CH4. Since there is no recent magmatic activity, the heat of the thermal springs can be attributed to the exchange of near surface water and crust at depth through deep open fractures.

Four water types were distinguished from geochemical diagrams. The relatively fresher waters include samples of Ca-HCO3 and Mg-HCO3 type waters originating from the schistose Rhodope Massif and the Quaternary basin of Aridea, respectively. Samples of the Na-HCO3 water type are typical of springs located in the post-orogenic basins of northern Greece. These hot, deep-rising Na-HCO3 waters circulate in a CO2-rich environment that favours the solubility of alkaline ions such as Na from siliceous rocks. Most of the samples belong to the Na-Cl water type and originate from Greek islands and coastal springs. These are characterized by the mixing of deep thermal solutions with seawater and fresh water. The presence of CO2 in thermal and mineral springs is due to the metamorphism of buried marine carbonate horizons while H2S is due to both local pyrite oxidation and the reduction of sulphates. The use of geothermometers suggested that the investigated geothermal areas have low enthalpy fluids at depth, while higher temperatures are likely present in Milos, Lesvos, Nisyros islands and Xanthi Basin.

J	Olichwer, T; Tarka, R				Olichwer, Tomasz; Tarka, Robert			Thermal and mineral springs of southern Spitsbergen	POLISH POLAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Arctic; Svalbard; thermal water; water chemistry	SVALBARD; HORNSUND	In the southern Spitsbergen area, thermal and mineral waters are primarily associated with subpermafrost deep circulation, being mixed with shallow circulation and glacial waters. Four thermal springs, located in the region of Stormbukta (Sorkappland), were studied and analyzed. In the thermal waters, the main cation is sodium, while the main anions are chloride and bicarbonate. The temperatures of the mineral and thermal waters range from 3.4 to 15.1 degrees C. The pH values are between 7.43 and 8.41. The total dissolved solids (TDS) content of the geothermal waters is in the range of 346-4031 mg/l and the Olsok thermal spring has the highest TDS values. Based on the variation in physicochemical characteristics, two thermal water types were distinguished in the study area. The first type is associated with thermal waters originating from deep circulation waters. The second type is associated with the thermal and mineral waters originating from the mixture of subpermfrost hot brines with glacial waters.

J	Shakeri, A; Moore, F; Kompani-Zare, M				Shakeri, Ata; Moore, Farid; Kompani-Zare, Mazda			Geochemistry of the thermal springs of Mount Taftan, southeastern Iran	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						thermal spring; Taftan volcano; geothermometry; Iran; hydrochemistry	WATERS; SYSTEM	Thermal and cold water chemistry from the southern flank of Mount Taftan was investigated in order to discriminate among hydrochemical facies, isotopic characteristics, geothermal reservoir and identify the major geochemical processes that affect water composition. The waters from both the hot and cold springs show high total dissolved solids content, and are strongly to lightly acidic. Calcium is the dominant cation; in terms of anions, the Taftan hot springs are Cl-SO4 type. There is also a HCO3 type cold spring. The SO4/Cl ratios on an SO4-Cl-HCO3 diagram confirm the volcanic origin of the hot waters. Conservative elements indicate that the three types of analysed water have similar origin and the difference in concentration is due to dilution of thermal water with almost shallow fresh groundwater, not affecting the elements' proportions. Also, the retrogressive delta O-18-enrichment with respect to the meteoric water line (MWL), confirms that thermal waters (andesitic water) have been diluted by shallow waters of meteoric origin. Comparison of the chemistry of thermal and cold springs and other evidences are indicative of an immature hydrothermal water system in Taftan volcano. Because of waters immaturity, temperatures in the geothermal reservoir in Taftan region cannot be estimated accurately by applying Na-K, K-Mg and quartz geothermometers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Source of Ra-226 in Ramsar spring water, Iran: implication of water-rock interaction and stable isotopes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Radium; Water; Rock interaction; Hydrogeochemistry; Stable isotopes; Ramsar	NATURAL RADIATION AREAS; BACKGROUND-RADIATION; THERMAL WATERS; HYDROGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES; GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; GODAVARI VALLEY; AQUIFER SYSTEM; TRACE-ELEMENTS; CENTRAL ALBORZ; HOT-SPRINGS	This study was carried out primarily to understand the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the Ra-226 anomalies in Ramsar area. Analyses revealed two types of water: (1) non-thermal Ca-HCO3 type and (2) thermal Na-Cl type, mainly of meteoric and hydrothermal origin, respectively. Non-thermal springs have higher concentrations of U due to silicate weathering. Thermal springs are characterized by high concentrations of Ra-226, As, Fe, Li, Cs, Rb, Sr, Ba, B, Br-, F-, NO3-, PO43- and SiO2 resulting from high-temperature water-rossck interaction and mixing with hydrothermal fluids. Thermal springs are manifestations of an old hydrothermal system with subsurface reservoir temperatures varying between 83 and 100 degrees C. Radium activity is negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with TDS, Cl-, Ba, and Ca, reflecting competitive ion effects of alkaline-earth metals, complexing with Cl-, and co-precipitation with barite and calcite. These processes are thought to be the dominant factors in controlling Ra-226 mobility in spring water.

J	Celmen, O; Celik, M				Celmen, Oktay; Celik, Mehmet			Hydrochemistry and environmental isotope study of the geothermal water around Beypazari granitoids, Ankara, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Geothermal springs; Environmental isotopes; Hydrochemistry; Beypazari granitoids; Ankara; Turkey	OXYGEN; SPRINGS; SYSTEM	Hydrochemical analysis results suggest four different water types: bicarbonate dominant water (facies-I), sulfate dominant cold brine water (facies-II), sodium-bicarbonate dominant thermal water and thermal and mineralized water (facies-III), and sulfate-chloride dominant thermal and mineralized water (facies-IV). The mineral content/salinity of the water is related to the ions that these waters dissolve from the minerals on the rocks during infiltration and circulation in the saturated zone. Gypsum cover units that exist on the granitoids in the region is the main factor for the ion increase in the facies III geothermal water similar to the cold brine water (facies II). Isotopic analyses indicate that the thermal springs (Dutlu bath spring, Ayas bath well, Coban bath well and Kapullu bath spring) are of meteoric origin and receive recharge from precipitation in the Beypazari granitoids and around gypseous formations with elevations of about 9501,150 m. Karakaya bath well and Ilica bath spring thermal water points are recharged from the Bilecik limestone hills, Tekke volcanics and Incedoruk Formations. Karakoca mineral spring of thermal and mineralized water is recharged from out of the study area. According to oxygen-18(SO42-) and sulfur-34 (So(4)(2-)) contents, sulfate in water samples from Ayas and Dutlu resorts as well as Coban bath is derived from the gypsum of Kirmir Formation as the primary source. Sulfates of the Kapullu bath water and Karakoca mineral water originate from secondary sources such as pyrite oxidation and bacteriological reduction.

Colitis was induced by 2 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water of C57BL/6 mice for 7 days. Some animal groups drank Harkany thermal spring water or water supplemented with 21.68 mg/L NaHS. General signs of colitis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity of colon samples, histological features of colitis and function of the enteric nervous system were assessed. Oral administration of Harkany thermal spring water significantly attenuated general signs of colitis, MPO enzyme activity of colon samples and detrimental effect of colitis on the function of the enteric nervous system, but not histological signs of colitis. These findings could be reproduced using NaHS solution with additional significantly diminished histological damage. We conclude that oral treatment with Harkany thermal spring water relieves various aspects of DSS-evoked colitis in mice. This effect is most likely to be mediated by hydrogen sulfide content of the Harkany water. Our data might promote complementary utilization of sulfurous thermal spring water in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.

To understand the processes that can affect water quality, this study carried out a geochemical study on cold (5 well water samples and 6 cold springs) and thermal (9 hot springs) waters in the Sarein-Nir area in Iran. A total of 20 water samples were collected in July 2016, and physicochemical variables such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and major, minor and trace element concentrations were determined. Using multivariate statistics, the main geochemical processes and possible origin of selected trace elements were investigated. The maturity and mixing processes of the waters were investigated using stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) and geothermometry techniques. It was found that water-rock interaction was the predominant process, and that denitrification and ion exchange processes also took place in the groundwater system of the area. Thermal waters had an elevated EC, whereas cold waters showed elevated pH and NO3 values, indicating the impact of anthropogenic activities on water quality. Alkalinity and temperature were recognized as the most important variables that control the release of trace elements into the groundwater. Most thermal water samples were immature and belonged to peripheral water types, indicating that these samples came in part from deep circulation. Geothermometry of the thermal waters showed that the springs of the Sarein region had high temperatures compared to the springs of the Nir region. Considering that the Sarein spring waters had lower deuterium ratios than spring waters in the Nir region, it was concluded that the recharge elevation of the Sarein springs was higher than that of the Nir springs.

J	Haselwimmer, C; Prakash, A; Holdmann, G				Haselwimmer, Christian; Prakash, Anupma; Holdmann, Gwen			Quantifying the heat flux and outflow rate of hot springs using airborne thermal imagery: Case study from Pilgrim Hot Springs, Alaska	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Thermal infrared; FLIR; Hot springs; Heat flux; Outflow rate; Geothermal; Heat-loss; Pilgrim Hot Springs; Alaska; Resource assessment; Monitoring	TEMPERATURE	In undertaking heat loss studies of geothermal systems, it is important to consider the heat flux associated with the outflow of thermal waters at hot springs, which may account for over 50% of the total natural surface heat loss. Conventional in-situ methods for quantifying hot spring heat flux may not always be feasible if there are low rates of flow or thermal waters are not confined to well-defined drainage channels. This paper describes the use of high spatial resolution airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery for quantifying the heat flux and corresponding outflow rate of hot springs using a case study of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. The approach is based upon the use of a simplified, steady-state, heat budget model that describes the heat gains and losses from areas of thermal water to calculate the hot spring heat flux required to maintain the temperature of these waters above ambient conditions. Inputs to the model include calibrated surface temperature maps for areas of thermal water derived from processing of airborne TIR imagery acquired using a broadband forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera as well various atmospheric variables relevant to the thermodynamics of water bodies. The model is applied on a per-pixel basis to provide maps of the hot spring heat flux for the thermal waters. The total hot spring heat flux, representing the sum of the per-pixel heat fluxes, is used to calculate a corresponding hot spring outflow rate assuming a fixed hot spring temperature. This approach has been applied to TIR imagery acquired during two surveys over Pilgrim Hot Springs in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. Although the heat budget model is particularly sensitive to wind speed, the results provide conservative estimates of the hot spring heat flux and outflow rates (at 81.3 degrees C) of similar to 4.7-6.7 MW thermal energy, and similar to 976-1400 1/min, respectively. These results are 2-3 times higher than field-based estimates of the hot spring heat flux derived using direct measurements of the flow rate in streams draining part of the thermal catchment at the site. This result is consistent with the synoptic capabilities of the airborne TIR data that map all areas of thermal water. This approach has significant potential as a rapid and repeatable method for quantitative investigations of spring-dominated geothermal systems in support of resource assessment, and long-term monitoring.

However, so far many studies on balneotherapy in pediatric AD have included relatively small populations without identifying patients' characteristics associated with their response. The aim of the present study was to identify any features associated with the clinical response to the Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy in a large cohort of pediatric AD patients. Methods An observational study was conducted on 867 children aged <= 16 years (females 50.5%, mean patient's age 5.9 years, standard deviation +/- 3.6 years) with mild to severe AD who underwent balneotherapy at the Comano thermal spring water center (Comano, Trentino, Italy) from April to October 2014. Patients were stratified according to their disease severity, which was evaluated using five SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) categories before and immediately after a thermal spring water balneotherapy course. Potential characteristics associated with the patients' clinical response to Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy were investigated. Results A statistically significant improvement in AD severity was observed after Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of patients achieving improvement in AD severity was reported among children <= 4 years old (p < 0.0001) with early-onset AD (p < 0.0001), severe AD (p < 0.0001) or coexistent reported food allergies (p < 0.01). The therapy was well tolerated, and no relevant adverse effects were reported during the treatment course. Conclusions Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy is a safe complementary treatment for pediatric patients with AD, as it was able to reduce the disease severity, especially in children <= 4 years old, with early onset AD, severe AD or concomitant food allergies.

The chemical composition of water is naturally different from one another. The predominant cations are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium whereas the anions include chloride, sulphate, carbonate and bicarbonate. On the basis of cation and anion percentage, thewaters of thermal springs are categorized as NaCl, NaHCO3 and CaHCO3 types. The thermal spring water of Attri, Tarabalo, Deuljhori and Taptapani are of NaCl type while that of Magarmuhan, Bankhol and Badaberena are NaHCO3 type and that of Boden is CaHCO3 type. The analysis data are plotted on Piper trilinear diagram, Stiff diagram Wilcox diagram and U.S salinity diagram in order to determine the quality of the water. The quality of water of the thermal springs has led to infer its suitability for the use in drinking and agricultural purposes. The total dissolved solids (TDS) value is low for the thermal springs of Odisha, which indicate a modest amount of mineral content. Nevertheless, presence of radioactive elements imparts a therapeutic character. Geothermometry with respect to Na/K and Na-K-Ca geothermometer are carried out to determine the reservoir temperature of the thermal springs. The above process led to calculate the highest base temperature at Tarabalo thermal spring area.											43	0	0	0	4	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							49	73		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_5	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		25	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400006

Though they are located at two different geological set up, they fall in Na-HCO3 facies. The imprints of basalt - thermal water interaction at Rajapur and local equilibration of doleritic dyke with the thermal water of Irde is deduced. The reservoir of the Rajapur thermal spring is likely to be located in the Precambrian formations,as that of Puttur thermal springs and hence the chemical processes undergoing in these systems are similar. The reservoir temperatures estimated using chemical geothermometers are about 200 degrees C and >120 degrees C for the Puttur and Rajapur thermal springs respectively. Illite, K-mica, chlorite, kaolinite, Ca-montmorillonite and philipsite are the expected secondary minerals in the system.

The Rehai geothermal field is also a high-temperature geothermal system, with a magmatic heat source which shows geothermal manifestations similar to those in Batang, especially in the Rekeng area. In this study, we compared the chemical compositions of different thermal springs in the Batang geothermal field with those in the Rehai geothermal field, to ascertain whether the thermal spring waters in Batang are also influenced by magma degassing or not. Further, we investigated the hydrogeochemical processes involved in forming the various thermal springs in the Batang geothermal field. We find that the thermal waters in the Batang geothermal field are not influenced by magma degassing. Although inorganic carbon, including HCO3- and CO32- is the dominant anion component of most of the thermal waters in the Batang geothermal field, SO42- is present in variable amounts. In this area, the mixing of the thermal waters with steam containing some amount of H2S generated by metamorphism probably causes the relatively high SO42- concentration in the neutral thermal springs. Also, beneath the Rekeng area, there is a deep reservoir with the temperature of about 180 degrees C; a shallow reservoir of a relatively low temperature of about 75 degrees C was also identified in the eastern part. About half of the thermal spring waters in Rekeng directly originate in the deep reservoir, mixing with little or no snow-melt water and steam. Conversely, no steady reservoir exists beneath the Bogexi area. We attribute the high levels of Ca2+, Mg2+ and TIC (total inorganic carbon) in the thermal spring waters in the Bogexi area to the carbonate geologic stratum distributed at the outlets of the springs.

Thermal springs issue in the mid-valley area along a 300-m lateral section of ash-flow tuff, and range in temperature from 21 to 29.8-degrees-C in early summer and from 15 to 17-degrees-C in mid-summer. Concentrations of major and minor chemical constituents in the thermal waters are nearly identical regardless of temperature. Waters in the downvalley parts of the rivers draining the 1921 deposits are mainly mixtures of cold meteoric waters and thermal waters of which the mid-valley thermal spring waters are representative. The weathering reactions of cold waters with the 1912 deposits appear to have stabilized and add only subordinate amounts of chemical constituents to the rivers relative to those contributed by the thermal waters. Isotopic data indicate that the mid-valley thermal spring waters are meteoric, but data is inconclusive regarding the heat source. The thermal waters could be either from a shallow part of a hydrothermal system beneath the 1912 vent region or from an incompletely cooled, welded tuff lens deep in the 1912 ash-flow sheet of the upper River Lethe area. Bicarbonate-sulfate waters resulting from interaction of near-surface waters and the cooling 1953-1968 southwest Trident plug issue from thermal springs south of Katmai Pass and near Mageik Creek, although the Mageik Creek spring waters are from a well-established, more deeply circulating hydrothermal system. Katmai caldera lake waters are a result of acid gases from vigorous drowned dissolving in lake waters composed of snowmelt and precipitation.

J	Vesper, DJ; Bausher, E; Downey, A				Vesper, Dorothy J.; Bausher, Emily; Downey, Autum			Comparison of microbial indicators and seasonal temperatures as means for evaluating the vulnerability of water resources from karst and siliciclastic springs	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Karst; Springs; Vulnerability; Thermal conditions; USA	TRANSPORT; VALLEY; HEAT; FLOW	Spring water is a critical resource in many parts of the world, however, there are few effective and efficient means of evaluating the vulnerability and sustainability of those resources. This study compares two approaches to evaluate the relative vulnerability of water sources from carbonate- and siliciclastic-sourced springs. The first approach uses a West Virginia protocol for source water assessment; the protocol uses temperature variability and bacterial indicators to identify groundwater influenced by surface water. In the second approach, near-continuous spring temperature data were modeled to quantify seasonal thermal patterns. This comparison was applied to five springs in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province, USA. The seasonal thermal patterns in the springs were compared to the modeled air temperature to determine thermal damping and pattern lag. Springs with the least damping and shortest lag were considered to be the most vulnerable to surface influences. In general, both approaches identified the same springs as the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable. In neither approach was the outcome controlled by the geologic unit or rock type. Although long-term data sets are needed to evaluate spring water vulnerability based on thermal patterns, those data are reasonably cost-effective to obtain, and the models require no assumptions about the flow system. The thermal lag times may also be useful in determining integrated residence times for groundwater between recharge input and spring output. These residence times may provide a means to compare the sustainability of springs when lack of data or access limit the use of more complex models.

Assessment of the biological water quality and response of freshwater macroinvertebrates to thermal stress in an Afrotropical warm spring	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Conservation; Functional feeding guilds; Ikogosi Warm Spring; Multimetric macroinvertebrate index; Temperature	MULTIMETRIC INDEX; BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES; TEMPERATURE; ECOSYSTEMS; INTEGRITY; STREAMS; FLOWS	Freshwater macroinvertebrates have been widely used as environmental stress indicators. However, information on their response to natural thermal stress is relatively scarce, particularly in the tropics. Using the multimetric macroinvertebrate approach, the biological water quality of the warm and cold springs of the Ikogosi Warm Spring in Nigeria was evaluated, with a view to ascertaining the response of freshwater macroinvertebrates to natural thermal stress. Macroinvertebrates and water samples were collected from the warm (stressed) and cold (less-stressed) springs, as well as the confluence stream, within the renowned Ikogosi Warm Spring of Southwest Nigeria. The less-stressed cold spring had much more dissolved oxygen than the warm spring and other thermally stressed stations but less than the warm spring and other thermally stressed stations for water temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, Ca2+, Mg2+, and water hardness. Generally, the macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness (30 species) and EPT richness (3 species) of the Ikogosi Warm Spring indicated an impaired freshwater system. Using the multimetric macroinvertebrate index (MMI), the warm spring was of poor biological water quality while the cold spring was of good biological water quality. At the confluence of both springs, the MMI declined to poor and moderate water quality. Although the thermal stress of the Ikogosi Warm Spring is natural, the government should take the necessary steps to regulate tourist activities so that the site's naturalness is preserved and the water quality is not further degraded on account of human-induced stressors such as deforestation, waste dumping, and washing activities.

Conventional physicochemical properties were measured in situ; dissolved solids and isotopic composition were analyzed. Two main spring locations on the east side of the Dead Sea were mapped. It became evident, that the hottest springs are among the closest to prominent faults; some springs are controlled by gas lift. Jordan's hot springs are described by means of a broad hydrochemical and physicochemical data set and several figures are presented. Based on their hydrochemistry, the thermal springs are classified into four thermal provinces. Water genesis is discussed. Several geothermometers are applied to estimate reservoir temperatures. Observed discharge rate, water temperature and isotopic composition are compared with data from the literature. Although discharge and water temperature are reported to be constant over the last decades, groundwater overexploitation led to a shift of the isotopic composition, what is documented for the first time in Jordan. Thus, the effect of groundwater mining on Jordan's hot springs can be stated as a fact.

Distilled water, mineral water and spring water with different TDS content were taken as base fluids. By dispersing 0.02% and 0.04% volume fraction of MWCNTs, six different nanofluids were prepared by the two-step preparation process. Thermal conductivity of the prepared specimen was measured and the result proves that as the TDS content of water increases the enhancement in the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid gradually decreases. Also the nanofluid prepared with spring water as the basefluid exhibited a lower thermal conductivity compared to the plain spring water. The reduction in the thermal conductivity in the case of spring water based nanofluids is due to the poor stability of the suspension which is apparent from the results of the zeta potential analysis. This anomalous behaviour extends the application of MWCNTs for primary water treatment process.	[Prasad, M. J. Giri; Santharaj, N. Jerome; Raaj, A. S.

There are many mineral and thermal water springs in the area with flow rates ranging between 0.01 - 0.4 1/s. Geochemical and isotope chemistry studies were carried out at three different thermal springs in the region as well as three different cold water springs during May-October 2011. The temperature of mineral and thermal waters were measured as between 21.1 degrees C - 23.6 degrees C in May 2011 and as 20.8 degrees C in October 2011. The region was determined as a low geothermal area and the reason for this is thought to be cold water mixing. The pH values of mineral and thermal spring waters were measured to be between 6.19 -6.69, EC values were measured to be between 1420 mu S/cm and 2720 mu S/cm, pH values of shallow and deep wells ranged between 6.04 and 7.82, whereas EC values were measured approximately between 275 mu S/cm and 3300 mu S/cm. The MgHCO3 water type dominates the chemistry of mineral and thermal water in study area. The results of O-18 and H-2 isotope analysis yield that the springs of mineral and thermal waters as well as cold waters are fed by meteoric rains. It was determined that the Ispendere mineral and thermal waters have low tritium (H-3), low Cl and high EC values. Reservoir rock temperatures have been estimated to be between 95 -132 degrees C as a result of the quartz geo-thermometer calculations.

J	Nathenson, M; Thompson, JM; White, LD				Nathenson, M; Thompson, JM; White, LD			Slightly thermal springs and non-thermal springs at Mount Shasta, California: Chemistry and recharge elevations	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Mount Shasta; springs; geothermal systems; stable isotopes	GROUNDWATER-FLOW; OREGON CASCADES; DISCHARGE; HEAT; GEOTHERMOMETER; TEMPERATURES; ISOTOPES; SYSTEMS; RATES; RANGE	Temperature measurements, isotopic contents, and dissolved constituents are presented for springs at Mount Shasta to understand slightly thermal springs in the Shasta Valley based on the characteristics of non-thermal springs. Non-thermal springs on Mount Shasta are generally cooler than mean annual air temperatures for their elevation. The specific conductance of non-thermal springs increases linearly with discharge. temperature. Springs at higher and intermediate elevations on Mount Shasta have fairly limited circulation paths, whereas low-elevation springs have longer paths because of their higher-elevation recharge. Springs in the Shasta Valley are warmer than air temperatures for their elevation and contain significant amounts of chloride and sulfate, constituents often associated with volcanic hydrothermal systems. Data for the Shasta Valley springs generally define mixing trends for dissolved constituents and temperature. The isotopic composition of the Shasta Valley springs indicates that water fell as precipitation at a higher elevation than any of the non-thermal springs. It is possible that the Shasta Valley springs include a component of the outflow from a proposed 210degreesC hydrothermal system that boils to supply steam for the summit acid-sulfate spring. In order to categorize springs such as those in the Shasta Valley, we introduce the term slightly thermal springs for springs that do not meet the numerical criterion of 10degreesC above air temperature for thermal springs but have temperatures greater than non-thermal springs in the area and usually also have dissolved constituents normally found in thermal waters.

As thermal springs are a significant part of Hungary's water resources, it is important to quantify their travel times in the karst systems. Thus, we chose to measure T and delta(18)O in the water and delta(13)C and C-14 in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in water from 50 thermal and nonthermal springs and wells in the Bukk Mountains, northeastern Hungary, Environmental isotope data confirm the karst waterflow pattern implied by earlier studies. We found the water in warm springs and boreholes to be mixtures of cold young and old thermal water. We also determined short mean-residence times for some large cold springs. The C-14 activities measured in these springs indicate that the recharge area of the karst aquifer is open to the atmosphere, and atmospheric CO2 contributes to the C-14 activity of these groundwaters. We observed good correlation between C-14 and H-3 activities and we determined negative correlations between C-14 concentration and delta(13)C values and temperature. From the delta(18)O values of the oldest thermal waters, we attribute their origin to precipitation during colder temperatures than at present.

Comparisons of the composition and biogeographic distribution of the bacterial communities occupying South African thermal springs with those inhabiting deep subsurface fracture water	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						subsurface; thermal springs; diversity; 16S rRNA gene; V6 hypervariable region	PRESENT-DAY SERPENTINIZATION; LIMPOPO PROVINCE; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; SP-NOV.; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; EXTRACELLULAR DNA; RARE BIOSPHERE; NATIONAL-PARK; GOLD MINE; SEA	South Africa has numerous thermal springs that represent topographically driven meteoric water migrating along major fracture zones. The temperature (40-70 degrees C) and pH (8-9) of the thermal springs in the Limpopo Province are very similar to those of the low salinity fracture water encountered in the South African mines at depths ranging from 1.0 to 3.1 km. The major cation and anion composition of these thermal springs are very similar to that of the deep fracture water with the exception of the dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved O-2, both of which are typically higher in the springs than in the deep fracture water. The in situ biological relatedness of such thermal springs and the subsurface fracture fluids that feed them has not previously been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the microbial diversity of six thermal spring and six subsurface sites in South Africa using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions. Proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phylum within both subsurface and thermal spring environments, but only one genera, Rheinheimera, was identified among all samples. Using Morisita similarity indices as a metric for pairwise comparisons between sites, we found that the communities of thermal springs are highly distinct from subsurface datasets. Although the Limpopo thermal springs do not appear to provide a new window for viewing subsurface bacterial communities, we report that the taxonomic compositions of the subsurface sites studied are more similar than previous results would indicate and provide evidence that the microbial communities sampled at depth are more correlated to subsurface conditions than geographical distance.

Detailed investigations over the last few decades culminated in the development of a vast geochemical database for thermal springs and associated gaseous phases, which are now available online since the late 1960s. After a careful evaluation of their quality and reliability, these data have been used in this study. Representative datasets of thermal spring waters from each group and subgroup have been evaluated following a classical approach, including water classifications, use of the triangular diagrams, geothermometric estimates and isotopic signatures that identified significant hydrogeochemical variations among different thermal spring clusters. Differences in rock-water interactions, and system characteristics such as water source, heat source, and topographic relief, were found to be the causes of observed variations. Thermal springs near the coast of western India have a high Cl content relative to Na, indicating that they have been influenced by seawater. Most thermal springs in the northern territory have high HCO3 and low Cl, suggesting that they have mixed with HCO3-rich near-surface water. Due to their emergence from the Precambrian crystallines, most thermal springs in the central and eastern part of India are distributed within the Na-Cl and Na-Cl-HCO3 type facies with low SO4 content. Different geochemical thermometers such as silica, cation thermometers, and a combination of silica K-Mg systems were used to estimate reservoir temperatures, resulting in a temperature range of roughly 60-140 degrees C. Because of the lack of equilibrium, the values of reservoir temperatures between 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C obtained using Na-K geothermometers may not be reliable. In general, the reservoir temperatures for thermal springs in India's northern and eastern parts are greater than those located in the southern and western continental margins. The chemistry of the associated gaseous discharges is dominated by atmospheric components. The exceptions are thermal springs from the Orogenic belt of Himalaya that are enriched with CO2 possibly sourced from metamorphic decarbonation. The He-3/He-4 isotopic ratio in the gaseous discharge across all the groups and subgroups predominantly bears signatures of crustal origin. Stable isotopic signatures strongly suggest that these hydrothermal systems are predominantly recharged by local meteoric waters. In contrast, a discernible positive oxygen-isotopic shift in thermal waters indicates the existence of high enthalpy reservoirs in the NW Himalayan region. With the exception of a few springs, long circulation time (>50 years) of meteoric waters within the conduit is indicated by low tritium values in the thermal waters.

The different physical parameters of the thermal springs such as temperature, pH, colour, odour and rate of discharge of the thermal fluid are noted. The temperature of surface water of the thermal springs ranges from 32 (Boden) to 67 degrees C (Tarabalo). The pH value of the thermal waters shows a neutral to mildly alkaline (pH 7.4-7.8) character. All the thermal springs discharge colourless and clear hot water. Sulphur odour is discernible particularly at Attri, Tarabalo, Deuljhori, Taptapani and Badaberena. The volume of water released remains more or less constant for all springs and the rates of discharge recorded at different locations are different and is found to be the maximum at Magarmuhan.											8	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							41	47		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_4	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		7	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400005

Although it is plausible that the thermal waters originate from a deep reservoir in siliceous rocks, it appears that a significant component of their hydrochemical signature is derived from dissolution of higher-level Hecla Hoek marbles. Rare earth elements (REEs) show some degree of enrichment of heavy REEs in the water phase, relative to the marbles and to the travertines that precipitate from the waters. A strong positive Eu anomaly is also observed in the waters, suggesting preferential mobilisation of Eu under reducing conditions. The ratio Nb/Ta is rather well-preserved between the marbles, the waters and the travertines. (C) 1999 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we examined the species-specific responses of aquatic insects to variation in water temperature at 43 undamaged spring fens. Temperature was recorded for 1 year using dataloggers and used to model the abundance of taxa representing spring habitat specialists and generalists, as well as traits indicative of species sensitivity to climate change. Sites differed significantly in thermal conditions, forming a gradient that was largely independent of other principal environmental gradients in the spring fens. Significant responses to temperature parameters were found for 25 of the 56 taxa analysed, showing two types of species associations, with stable or variable thermal conditions. The species significantly responding to temperature variables by an increase or decrease in their abundance were primarily spring specialists, often associated with thermally stable sites with higher winter temperatures. The number of climate-sensitive traits within the insect assemblage was also higher at these sites. Thus, any reduction of water temperature stability may negatively affect many spring specialists and species vulnerable to climate changes. Our results highlight the importance of thermal conditions, particularly temperature stability, for spring insects.

Thermal water composition of these springs are natural to weak acid and indicate that sulphate content varies from 95 to 1407 (mg/l), HCO3 from 167 to 1257 (mg/l), chloride from 10 to 438 (mg/l), Calcium from 129 to 691 (mg/l), sodium from 18 to 229 (mg/l), silica upto15 (mg/l). Ca is dominate cation and SO4, HCO3 are dominate anion, so, Cl-SO4 -HCO3 ternary diagram suggests the thermal waters are immature and classify in two type, in type1 Strabaku and Larijan thermal springs have Magmatic steam and steam-heated waters origin, in other hand, in type2 Ask thermal waters relate to Peripheral and shallow water origin, both type show a mixing of magmatic gases and volcanic steams with shallow ground water. Schoeller semi-logarithmic diagram confirm all the thermal waters have similar chemical characteristics to cold water. Because of waters immaturity, temperatures in the deep reservoir in Damavand area cannot be estimated clearly, Thus, Deep reserve temperature calculated by Quartz and Na-K geothermometers, so, Quartz geothermometer shown a range of reservoir temperatures from 53 degrees C to 94 degrees and Na-K geothermometr, shown a range of reservoir temperatures from 232 degrees C to 265 degrees C.

Occurrence and distribution of Naegleria species from thermal spring environments in Taiwan	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						environmental; recreational water; protozoa; polymerase chain reaction	REAL-TIME PCR; IDENTIFICATION; INHIBITION; AREAS	Naegleria spp. is a free-living amoeba that can be found in the natural environment. A number of Naegleria spp. can cause fatal infections in the central nervous system in humans and animals, and the most important source of infection is through direct water contact. In this study, water samples from various thermal springs were taken from four thermal spring areas. Naegleria spp. was detected via culture confirmation and molecular taxonomic identification. Among the 60 samples obtained, Naegleria spp. was identified in 26 (43.3%) samples. The identified species included Naegleria australiensis, Naegleria gruberi, Naegleria lovaniensis and Naegleria mexicana. The presence of living Naegleria spp. was significantly associated with elevated pH value in the water sample. Significance and Impact of Study In this study, we examined the presence of living Naegleria spp. in thermal spring waters in south-eastern Taiwan. Naegleria spp. was isolated and culture-confirmed from thermal spring water. Naegleria fowleri was not found in all water samples, and Naegleria australiensis was the most common Naegleria genotype.

The reservoir temperatures from these thermal waters were calculated by applying all the available 28 solute geothermometers and the obtained temperatures were compared with the bottom hole temperatures (BHT) of the geothermal wells. Thermal waters of springs and geothermal wells of Cerro Prieto geothermal field (CPGF) are Cl type and majority of them are partially equilibrated. In the case of Los Humeros geothermal field (LHGF), spring waters are HCO3 type and all of them have indicated non-equilibrium conditions. Majority of the predicted reservoir temperatures by Na/K geothermometers from spring waters of CPGF and LHGF are within +/- 20 % differences compared to average BHTs, whereas estimated temperatures by all other solute geothermometers (non-Na/K) from spring waters of both the geothermal fields have shown wide differences (> +/- 20 %). In the case of geothermal well waters, majority of the reservoir temperatures estimated by only Na/K geothermometers from well waters of CPGF are within +/- 20 % differences and in the case of wells of LHGF, majority of the reservoir temperatures estimates by all solute geothermometers are having differences > +/- 20 %. The present study indicates the following: (1) only 3 geothermometers (out of 28) from spring waters of CPGF have predicted reservoir temperatures similar (statistically no significant differences) to the average of BHTs, although all springs are of Cl type; (2) different chemical characteristics of spring and well waters of CPGF and LHGF may be the result of the wide differences in the lithology of their reservoirs; (3) more number of solute geothermometers from non-equilibrated spring waters of CPGF and LHGF have predicted reliable reservoir temperatures than partially equilibrated waters; (4) In general, Na/K geothermometers have predicted more reliable reservoir temperatures from spring and well waters of both geothermal fields, when compared to other solute geothermometers; (5) the prediction of non-reliable reservoir temperatures by other than Na/K geothermometers may be the result of dilution/ mixing of deep thermal waters with the meteoric surface waters; and (6) more number of geothermometers have predicted reliable reservoir temperatures from well waters in comparison to spring waters of both the studied geothermal fields.

The average temperature of the springs is about 40 C and the waters have appreciable amounts of dissolved solids and hydrogen sulfide. Based on chemical analyses, including stable isotopes of the thermal waters and data interpretations, and on a comparison with fresh water springs and wells in the study area, we conclude that the hot waters are of meteoric origin. Because of the prevailing geothermal gradient, the waters are heated as they circulate deep in the system through joints, fractures and the Ghatar-Kazeroon fault. During their deep circulation, the waters come into contact with Hormoz Series evaporites and the oilfield brines, resulting in an increase in dissolved ion concentrations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying water sources in a karst aquifer using thermal signatures	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Water temperature; Epikarst; Mixing model; Northwest Arkansas	SOUTH-CENTRAL INDIANA; INFILTRATION; TRANSPORT; SPRINGS; SYSTEMS; HEAT; FLOW; HYDROGRAPHS; DISCHARGE; CONDUIT	Using thermal data, a unique approach to delineate flow components in a karsts aquifer was conducted. Thermal signatures from seven wells and six springs were analyzed to determine potential relationships among different storage reservoirs and the air temperature. The temperature signatures revealed three distinct reservoirs: epikarst, shallow groundwater, and deep groundwater. The reservoirs have different thermal signatures and relationships with the air temperature. During a wetter period, the epikarst water temperatures more closely follow the air temperature trend and are closer in value, but during drier conditions, the shallow groundwater temperatures are more similar in value to air temperature. Deep groundwater temperatures show no relationship to variations in surface air temperature. Using the water temperatures from the three reservoirs, the sources of water at two major springs, Copperhead and Langle, were delineated. During the wetter period, the shallow groundwater and the epikarst were the primary contributors of water to the springs. As conditions became drier a transition occurred, the deep groundwater became the major source of water to the springs. Variation in temperatures of waters at Copperhead and Langle spring is a result of the epikarst and the shallow groundwater, which represents ineffective thermal reservoirs.

The reservoir temperature was calculated using the mineral saturation index and geothermometers. According to isotopic analysis, the spring water was of meteoric origin. Sixteen springs in the Arxan geothermal system with outlet temperatures ranging from 10.9 to 41.0 degrees C were investigated. The water samples can be classified into four groups by using a Piper diagram. The aquifer in which the Group I and Group III samples were obtained was a shallow cold aquifer of the Jurassic system, which is related to the local groundwater system and contains HCO3-Ca center dot Na groundwater. The Group II and Group IV samples were recharged by deeply circulating meteoric water with HCO3-Na and HCO3 center dot SO4-Na center dot Ca groundwater, respectively. The springs rise from the deep basement faults. The estimated thermal reservoir temperature is 50.9-68.8 degrees C, and the proportion of shallow cold water ranges from 54% to 87%. A conceptual flow model based on hydrogeochemical results and hydrogeological features is given to describe the geothermal system of the Arxan springs.

Hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of Changal thermal springs, Zagros region, Iran	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Thermal spring; Hydrogeochemistry; Geothermometry; Zagros region; Iran	MECHANISM; WATERS	This study addresses the hydrogeochemistry of thermal springs that emerge from the Asmari limestone in a gorge at Changal Anticline in the vicinity of the Salman-Farsi dam. The Changal thermal springs vary in temperature between 28 and 40 degrees C. Chemical and isotopic compositions of the thermal waters suggest two distinct hydrogeological systems: a deep, moderate-temperature (similar to 40 degrees C) geothermal system recharged by deeply circulating meteoric waters, and a shallow cold aquifer system related to local groundwater. The source geothermal fluid temperature was calculated using different geothermometers and mineral saturation indexes. Based on chemical and isotopic data, it is hypothesized that: (1) mixing occurs between the ascending geothermal water and shallow cold water: (2) the resulting thermal waters reaching surface are a mixture of 80% local, shallow meteoric water and 20% geothermal water; and (3) the circulation depth of the meteoric water is about 1500 m. The thermal reservoir temperature is estimated to be between 70 and 80 degrees C according to calculations using different geothermometers and computation of saturation indices for different solid phases.

Water flow characteristics were deduced using in situ deployments of three marine sensors: an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV), a High-Frequency Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and a medium-resolution underwater gamma-ray detection system. The flow velocity combined with the activity concentration of natural radionuclides in the thermal spring provided information on the characteristics of the thermal spring in the specific gulf. The proposed methodology estimated the water supply, the residence time in the effective area of the in situ systems, and the residence time in the gulf. Eventually, the estimation of the characteristics of the discharged water source resulted from the synthetic evaluation of oceanographic measurements alongside appropriate models.

J	PRITCHARD, G				PRITCHARD, G			INSECTS IN THERMAL SPRINGS	MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA			English	Review								Thermal springs are characterized by year-round high temperatures and a total-dissolved-solids concentration that is generally higher than that of surface waters. Insects appear to encounter few constraints from the water chemistry of most thermal springs, but considerable constraint from the high water temperature. Indeed, because no insect lives above 50-degrees-C and very few above 40-degrees-C, few thermal springs offer favorable conditions for insects in the actual boil itself. Thermal spring insects live in the stream at some distance from the source, and they may be defined as living in habitats having temperature regimens that are influenced by geothermy in the sense that they are warmer than they otherwise would be. An annual mean water temperature that is 5-degrees-C above the annual mean air temperature of the region can be used to define the downstream limit of geothermal influence. Thermal springs around the world have similar insect faunas; only four orders (Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata) are commonly represented, and each of these only by a handful of genera. Furthermore, the fauna of any one thermal spring is characterized by very few species, and the higher the temperature the lower the species richness. Both temperature and water chemistry may exclude certain species, and even whole orders, from thermal springs, these factors acting either directly, alone or in concert, or indirectly through competitive interactions. Even moderately warmed systems can significantly affect insect growth rates, and seasonal regulation of adult emergence through diapause is a common strategy of temperate-zone thermal spring insects. Thermal springs present many advantages to the ecologist, such as long-term habitat constancy, temperature stability, and taxonomic simplicity. They provide field laboratories for the study of temperature-related phenomena as well as the opportunity to explore a range of questions in biogeography and evolutionary biology. The challenge is to form the questions and select the systems critically.

Multicomponent mineral equilibrium (MME) geo-thermometer calculations at Gisenyi prospects with the highest in situ measured temperature (73.1??C) showed the reservoir temperature of 90??6??C. The MME tempera-ture estimates agreed well with Silica-based, K-Mg and Mg-Li geothermometers while the other cation geother-mometers (Na-K, Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, and Na-Li) results are unreliable. Most of the non-thermal springs are Ca-Mg-HCO3 water-type while the thermal spring waters were majorly Na-HCO3. The ??D composition varied from-16.6 to-5.9%0 and from-11.8 to-5.0%0, while the ??18O ranged from-4.17 to-3.5%0 and-4.32 to-2.7%0, for ther-mal and non-thermal springs, respectively. All isotopic ratios scattered around the meteoric water lines, thus indicating their similar meteoric origin. In addition, there was no observable ??18O positive shift speculating less extent of water-rock interactions while geogenic CO2 ingress into the waters has been ascertained by both isotopic and chemical component ratios. We proposed a circulation mechanism of the thermal waters for the study area.

Several springs are located within the watershed of Santiago, and the objective of this study was to define the hydrogeochemical composition of the thermal springs and to characterize the geothermal reservoir. A total of 16 water samples were taken in 11 geothermal manifestations under dry (June 2014) and humid (March 2015) conditions. A geothermal system of low enthalpy and low mineralization was found along the San Jos del Cabo Fault (FSJC), with an average salinity (TDS) of 261 mg/L and an alkaline pH (8.5-9.5). The hydrogeochemical composition corresponds to the sodium-bicarbonate type, and geothermometers (silica and Na-K) indicate temperatures ranging from 70 to 115 degrees C for the deep thermal reservoir in conditions of equilibrium. The thermal springs with these hydrogeochemical characteristics differ in respect to the hydrochemical composition of the springs, formally described on several sites of BCS. Br/Cl and B/Cl ratios as well as the enrichment factor (EF) indicate that rainwater with a seawater component represents the source of the thermal spring water. In the springs, a mixture between thermal water and surface water is observed, combined with a relatively deep water circulation, allowing a calcium-sodium exchange, according to the host rock geochemistry. The higher temperatures found at some hot springs are related to the main trace of the San Jos del Cabo Fault.

Physico-chemical parameter (EC, pH, Temp.) and tritium content of groundwater, hot springs and surface water were measured. The temperature of the hot springs were varied from 60 to 98.8 A degrees C and EC from 674 to 728 mu S/cm. The tritium content of groundwater varies from 1.5 to 5 TU whereas, geothermal water have slightly less tritium and their values ranges from 1.4 to 4.4 TU. Low tritium, higher EC and high temperature of a few hot springs indicate insignificant mixing whereas high tritium, lower EC and low temperature indicates significant mixing of thermal and non-thermal water. The degree of mixing for geothermal springs is estimated. It is found that the groundwater components present in the diluted thermal waters are about 25-80%. It is also observed that mixing process is prominent along the fault and in the area where groundwater exploitation is more. Extensive pumping of groundwater causes an increase in the rate of mixing of thermal and non-thermal water. The tritium content of groundwater, surface water and hot springs are indicating, it is of modern recharge.	[Ansari, Md. Arzoo; Sinha, U. K.; Deodhar, Archana; Mendhekar, G.

J	Dutta, A; Gupta, RK				Dutta, Archisman; Gupta, Ramesh Kumar			Geochemistry and Utilization of Water from Thermal Springs of Tawang and West Kameng Districts, Arunachal Pradesh	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Article								The hydrogeochemical studies provide insights about reservoir conditions of geothermal springs along with utilization of thermal waters for domestic, livestock and irrigation purposes. Most of the hot springs of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh emanated through garnet bearing high grade gneiss-migmatite-schist-quartzite sequence of the Se La Group, except for Dirang hot springs which emanate from river terrace deposits lying on the footwall of deformed quartzite-phyllite. The thermal waters are of mixed Na-Ca-HCO3-SO4-Cl type, meteoric in origin and at the same time immature in nature, moving sluggishly towards mineral-fluid equilibration zone with slow rock-water interactions. Chemical geothermometry showed wide variation in estimation of sub-surface reservoir temperature and quartz geothermometry model fits prominently to provide the most reliable reservoir temperature varying within 90 +/- 40 degrees C. The studies recorded highest reservoir temperature of Thinghu hot spring with 133 degrees C with very high fluoride concentration in all the hot springs except Bishum and Phudung as per BIS (2012) IS: 10500 specifications. High fluoride and sulfate concentration in thermal spring waters make it unsuitable for drinking purpose. The applicability of thermal waters for irrigation is predicted through sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) calculations which showed that waters of Dirang-2, Sorbe and Kitpi-1&2 are not suitable for irrigation purpose due to high salinity and SAR values.

The exploitation of this energy depends on geothermal water parameters such as T degrees, pH, flow rate, and thermal power. Thirty one thermal springs were identified in our study area including Ouarsenis, Biban, and Kabylie provinces in the Tell Atlas, northern Algeria. These thermal springs are included by hammams, baths, and spas with hot waters exhibiting a mean temperature of 60 degrees C. Samples were collected during March 2018 on the thirty-one sites to evaluate the hydrochemical properties of hot waters and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ. The results show that the geothermal temperature of the reservoir in the study area is of approximately 130 degrees C. The temperature of hot waters varied between 22 and 80 degrees C. The pH revealed that the hot waters are acid; the flow rate varied from 0.8 to 30 L/s. The thermal power water calculated for all sites is ranged between 40 and 5020 KWth. This study is a part of a project related to a new global mapping of thermal spring parameters with corresponding geothermal energy potential. This potential is important for sustainable development by introducing geothermal energy instead of fossil energy.

Relatively higher macroinvertebrate abundance 94 (86.2%) was registered in Gergedi than any other thermal spring sites. The macroinvertebrate abundance was 9 (8.3%) and 6 (5.5%) for the Gara and Sodere thermal springs. No macroinvertebrate communities were observed in all sites of Halaba thermal spring. From all macroinvertebrate groups, 82 (75.2%) were dipterans, 20 (18.4%) Oligochaeta, 5 (4.6%) Gastropoda, and the rest Hemipterans and Coleopterans, which comprises 2 (1.8%) individuals. Chironomidae was the dominant invertebrate taxa at all sites, and when the water temperature exceeds 42 degrees C, it becomes the only taxon in the thermal springs. Macroinvertebrates were absent in thermal springs where the water temperature is 52 degrees C or higher. Other diversity measures were not sensitive enough to discriminate sampling sites regardless of physicochemical variabilities except the richness and abundance. Water temperature, chloride, pH, and phosphate were identified as major determinants of macroinvertebrate richness in the Ethiopian Rift Valley region.

The growth and lipolytic activity was evaluated and analyzed as function of ion concentrations in the culture media. Mineral composition of the water does not affect the maximum growth of T. thermophilus HB27. Nevertheless, the lipolytic activity was strongly enhanced when Burgas and Laias spring thermal water were used. This improvement cannot be obtained formulating culture media by adding to distilled water the main ions present in Burgas water separately. Thus, Ca2+, Mg2+ neither affect growth nor enzyme production and HCO3- inhibits maximum biomass and intracellular lipolytic activity productions but had a clear positive effect on extracellular lipolytic activity. These results suggest that a different or more complex ionic composition in the culture medium (as the present in the Burgas hot spring water) is necessary to enhance the lipolytic activity production in T thermophilus HB27.

S	Mahala, SC	Mahala, SC			Mahala, Subash Chandra	Mahala, SC		Genesis of Thermal Springs	GEOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND GENESIS OF THERMAL SPRINGS OF ODISHA, INDIA	SpringerBriefs in Earth Sciences		English	Article; Book Chapter								In this chapter an attempt has been made to infer about origin of heat, water, gas and mineral constituents related to thermal springs of Odisha and to correlate them with the genesis of thermal springs. The source of heat is considered as the geothermal gradient inside the earth, from fault zones during tectonic movement in the crust, chemical changes (exothermic reactions) and disintegration of radioactive elements. The fluid phase may be derived from percolation of meteoric water inside the crust through structural openings which is subsequently heated up and manifest in the form of hot springs on the surface of the earth. Water during circulation may be charged with atmospheric gases and this may be the cause of origin of nitrogen and oxygen etc. The gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are formed due essentially to decomposition of organic materials. The rare gas helium, associated with the thermal springs, is regarded to be originated by the disintegration of radioactive minerals. The mineral constituents present in the spring water are due to the rock assemblages through which the hot meteoric water has been circulated. The chemical constituents are formed due to interaction between hot meteoric water and the mineralogical composition of the rocks. The chemical components present in the thermal springs of Odisha have not only enabled to categorize the type of water but also impart therapeutic value.											16	0	0	0	5	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							83	90		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_7	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		8	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400008

The Native American Mono Tribe traditionally uses Mono Hot Springs for spiritual purposes, while simultaneously the Mono Hot Springs Resort holds a special-use permit for some of the geothermal waters. To support environmental assessments for area management, the Sierra National Forest studied thermal spring chemistry and temperature, evaluating potential use conflicts. An initial multi-year monitoring of 11 representative thermal springs was followed a decade later by another multi-year sampling of the same springs, providing insight into the geothermal character of Mono Hot Springs. Measured water temperatures ranged from 44.5 degrees C to 24.3 degrees C and pH from 8.0 to 7.03, depending upon the thermal spring, higher pH values correlating with lower temperatures. Thermal spring temperatures varied seasonally with higher temperatures in springtime and lower ones in autumn. pH did not exhibit a coherent seasonal variation. Mono Hot Spring temperature decreased and pH increased during the decade-long study period, with even greater longer-term temperature change evidenced at nearby Mono Crossing. Silica and cation geothermometry at Mono Hot Springs suggests that the geothermal waters reached equilibrium with 74-79 degrees C rock at depth at estimated pH of 5 to 6. The spatial distribution of neighboring thermal springs, regional seismicity, and mapped faults suggests that Mono Hot Springs rises along faults running nearly north-south, connecting to Mammoth Mountain and Long Valley, California, 30 km to the north.

These springs run parallel to the Western Ghats and geochemical studies denote that these hot water springs are of meteoritic origin that emerge from basement rock.To understand the geoelectric structure and possible source zone of hot water springs, a 26-station audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) survey was carried out along E -W profiles across Aravali, Tural and Rajawadi geothermal springs with a station spacing of about 1-1.5 km. A 2D inversion was carried out jointly for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) data after the distortion and decomposition analysis.These geothermal zones appear as high conductive zones at shallow depth and are associated with fault/ fracture zones within the sedimentary basin. The basement depth increases from 1 km to 2.5 km moving from Aravali to Rajawadi geothermal zones. Volcanic plugs at a shallow depth beneath Tural and Rajawadi thermal springs act as a source rock for heat. Thus, hot water temperatures are higher for these two thermal springs relative to Aravali thermal spring, which is devoid of magma intrusion and related to circulation of meteoric water over basement.

In the recent studies, the anomalous Rn-222/Ra-226 ratios have drawn the attention to the existence of local Rn-222 source. Biogeochemical precipitates (i.e. biofilms) in spring caves were found to have high adsorption capacity, accumulating e.g. Ra-226. Biogeochemical precipitates are ubiquitous in the thermal springs of BTK, occurring in different amount and colours (dark grey, brown, red, white), and have different microbial communities and elemental composition. The detailed investigation of the radioactivity of spring waters highlighted the different Ra-226 and Rn-222 activity concentrations. The present study aimed to survey the radioactivity of the thermal springs of Gellert Hill area, together with the biogeochemical precipitates and air above the water level, and to assess the evolution of the radioactivity of known-aged precipitates, formed during in situ experiments. We found that the basic physicochemical parameters of the spring waters (field parameters, major ions) do not affect the adsorption capacity of biogeochemical precipitates. It was revealed by the conducted in situ experiments, that the flow conditions influence the evolution rate of precipitates, so their adsorption capacity. The Rn-222 activity concentrations of spring waters are dependent on the area of the water surface, volume of air space above the water level, ventilation of the caves/channels and presence of calcite layer on the water surface. The latter has a blocking effect on degassing.

The source, fate, and transport of arsenic in the Yellowstone hydrothermal system-An overview	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Arsenic; Yellowstone; Hydrothermal; Microbial transformation; Aqueous geochemistry; Hot spring	DMSO REDUCTASE FAMILY; TATIO GEYSER FIELD; NATIONAL-PARK; SULFUR GEOCHEMISTRY; GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM; RAPID OXIDATION; THERMAL WATERS; GIBBON RIVERS; HOT-SPRINGS; OXIDASE	The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (YPVF) contains >10,000 thermal features including hot springs, pools, geysers, mud pots, and fumaroles with diverse chemical compositions. Arsenic (As) concentrations in YPVF thermal waters typically range from 0.005 to 4 mg/L, but an As concentration of 17 mg/L has been reported. Arsenic data from thermal springs, outflow drainages, rivers, and from volcanic rocks and silica sinter were used to identify the sources, characterize geochemical and microbial processes affecting As, and quantify As fluvial transport. Arsenic in YPVF thermal waters is mainly derived from high temperature leaching of rhyolites. Arsenic concentrations in thermal waters primarily depend on water type, which is controlled by boiling, evaporation, mixing, and mineral precipitation and dissolution. Springs with low As concentrations include acid-SO4 (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/L), NH4-SO4 rich (0.003 +/- 0.007 mg/L), and dilute thermal waters (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/L); travertine-forming waters have moderate As concentrations (0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/L); and neutral-Cl waters (1.2 +/- 0.8 mg/L) common in the western portion of the Yellowstone Caldera and Cl-rich waters (1.9 +/- 1.2 mg/L) primarily from Basins near the Caldera boundary have elevated As concentrations. Reduced As species (arsenite and thiolated-As species) are most prevalent near the orifice of hot springs, and then As rapidly oxidizes to arsenate along drainages. Previously published cultivation-based studies and metagenomic data from microbial communities inhabiting a variety of hot springs indicate a widespread distribution of arsenite oxidation and arsenate reduction capabilities among the hot springs. Widespread use and transformation of As by thermophilic microorganisms promotes more soluble and toxic forms. Most of the water discharged from thermal springs eventually ends up in a nearby river where As remains soluble and exhibits little attenuation during downstream transport. Since 2010, 183 +/- 10 metric tons/year of As were transported from Yellowstone National Park (YNP) via rivers. The discharge from YPVF thermal features impairs river water quality whereby As concentrations exceed 10 mu g/L for many rivers reaches within and downstream from YNP.	[McCleskey, R.

Physicochemical characteristics of the thermal water samples showed pH from 6.3 to 8.3 with an average of 7.0, redox potential from +106 to +204 mV with an average of +172 mV, temperatures from 40 to 75 degrees C with an average of 56 degrees C and high electrical conductivity ranging from 1.8 to 75 mS/cm and averaged 13 mS/cm. Predominant major ions are Na+ and Cl- and the principal water types are 37.5% Na -Cl type and 37.5% Na-Cl-HCO3 type. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 65.3 mu g/L and arsenic speciation indicate the predominance of As(III) species. Sediments collected from the outlets of thermal waters show high iron content, and ferric oxides and hydroxides are assumed to be principal mineral phases for arsenic attenuation by adsorption/co-precipitation processes. Arsenic concentrations in cold water samples from shallow aquifers are higher than those in thermal springs (range < 5.6-233.2 mu g/L), it is likely that thermal water discharge is not the main source of high arsenic content in the shallow aquifer as they are very immature and may only have a small component corresponding to the deep geothermal reservoir. As people use both thermal waters and cold waters for consumption, there is a high risk for arsenic exposure in the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mohammad			Environmental Water Chemistry and Dissolved Radon Concentration in a Thermal Spring	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						water chemistry; Gano thermal spring; salt diapir; radon	BASIN; GEOCHEMISTRY; MOUNTAINS; REGION; AREAS	Gano thermal spring is a karst spring located in the Zagros zone in southern Iran. Samples were collected in different seasons from this spring water. In addition to physicochemical factors, major and minor ions and dissolved radon concentration were measured at the sampling site using a RAD7 detector. The annual average temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) of Gano water spring is 41.2 degrees C and 17,417.5 mu s/cm. The pH is in the neutral range and average TDS is 10,442.5 mg/l. The water type is Na-Cl. High Concentrations of Na, Cl, and SO4 ions probably result from the Hormoz Series salt domes and the dissolution of halite, gypsum, and anhydrite. The Ca/Mg ratio in spring water indicates that the reservoir rocks are dolomitic limestone. Concentrations of elements such as Ag, Hg, Cd, Sn, Pb, Cr, Co, and Bi in Gano water varies from less than 0.5 to 1 mu g/l. The mean concentration of Rn-222 in Gano water is 29.2 kBq/m(3), so Gano is not a radon mineral spring. Mean annual effective Rn-222 doses for inhalation from the waters of Gano spring was computed to be 0.002 mu Svy(-1), which is less than the reference level recommended by WHO.	[Mirhosseini, S.

The interference of a deep thermal system with a shallow aquifer: the case of Sodere and Gergedi thermal springs, Main Ethiopian Rift, Ethiopia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Geophysical methods; Groundwater/surface-water relations; Thermal water; Volcanic aquifer; Ethiopia	LANGANO GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; ORIGIN; BASIN; WATER	An integrated survey program involving geological, hydrogeological and geophysical techniques has been employed to characterize the aquifer geometry, recharge and circulation dynamics of thermal springs within a shallow aquifer system in Ethiopia. The selected springs for the case study are Sodere and Gergedi, which are situated within the tectonically active Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). Geologically, the studied springs are located on Plio-Quaternary volcanic rocks. The geophysical results indicate the presence of subsurface weak zones represented by extensional tectonics and weathering zones which are responsible for thermal water circulation and facilitate recharge from the adjacent surface-water bodies. The structures inferred by the resistivity survey, both sounding and electrical tomography, present contrasts in rock resistivity response. The anomalous zones in the magnetic data are in good agreement with the zones that are revealed by geological mapping and surface manifestation of the thermal water discharge zones. The shallow aquifer of the central MER is under the influence of thermal water, which increases the groundwater temperature and mineral content.

J	Grasby, SE; Hutcheon, I; Krouse, HR				Grasby, SE; Hutcheon, I; Krouse, HR			The influence of water-rock interaction on the chemistry of thermal springs in western Canada	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							BRITISH-COLUMBIA; ISOTOPE; SULFATE; SULFUR; GEOTHERMOMETER; REDUCTION; DEPOSITS; FLUIDS; AGE	A comparison of new data with historical records indicates that the chemistry of thermal springs from the Canadian Cordillera is constant through time, suggesting that water compositions develop equilibrium with the host rock. A thermodynamic model is used to evaluate the influence of water-rock interaction on the chemistry of thermal spring waters. An isotope mass-balance approach Is used to evaluate biological controls on the S and C cycles in the springs. A comparison of mineral stability with water compositions suggests that the activities of major cations are controlled by equilibrium reactions with common rock forming minerals and alteration products. Sulfur has a complex redox history in thermal springs. Sulfate derived from dissolution of evaporite minerals is reduced by bacteria, causing the production of HS-. The loss of HS- from the system appears to be minor, instead it is reoxidized to SO4 as the spring water ascends to surface, Calculations indicate that the amount of SO4 that is reduced and reoxidized varies from 0 to 53%. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion of biological cycling of SO4 and the concentration of SO4, indicating that SO4 is not a limiting nutrient in hydrothermal systems. In low alkalinity thermal springs, HCO3 is derived from either dissolution of carbonate minerals or oxidized organic matter. However, for high alkalinity springs (>100 mg/l) HCO3 is dominantly derived from carbonate dissolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The chemical types of the thermal waters and the effects of mixing of shallow cold water with the thermal end-members are discussed. These waters are neutral to slightly alkaline and have low dissolved contents. Sodium is the dominant cation in almost all the cases. In terms of anions, the hot waters of Budelas are of the SO4 type, those of Tatta Pani are of mixed character (SO4 and HCO3), and the waters from the remaining areas show HCO3 domination. An absence of tritium in Tatta Pani and Tato thermal springs indicates that they do not have any contribution of shallow young water. In the case of the Murtazabad springs, the wide range of tritium concentrations, negative correlations with surface temperature and Cl, and positive correlation between Na and Cl show that the shallow cold ground-water is mixing with thermal water in different proportions. For the mixed water of Murtazabad thermal springs, 'isochemical modelling' using the Na-K, K-Mg and quartz geothermometers indicates an equilibrium temperature in the range 185-200 degreesC. The delta(18)O(SO4-H2O) geothermometer gives relatively low temperatures for three springs, whereas two samples are close to the 185-200 degreesC temperature interval. The reservoir temperatures of Tatta Pani springs (100-120 degreesC), determined by Na-K and quartz geothermometers, are in good agreement. The delta(18)O(SO4-H2O) geothermometer gives a relatively higher range (140-150 degreesC) for most of the Tatta Pani springs. For Tato spring, the isotope and chemical geothermometers (except for the K-Mg) agree on an equilibrium temperature of about 170 degreesC. Reservoir temperatures of the remaining minor fields are not conclusive due to the lack of sufficient data. (C) 2002 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Statistical calculations show that the hot and cold spring's number per unit area increases within the active faults number. It is established that an area with active faults density higher, than the mean value, is characterized by the maximum number of thermal springs. Correlation analysis showed that the number of modern mineral water springs per unit area and their temperature depend on the earth's crust fragmentation degree: zones of reduced density are characterized by rare but hotter thermal springs, and zones of increased density are characterized by numerous and colder thermal vents, which probably connects with water dilution by underground cold waters in a more fractured geological environment.

J	Allen, DM; Grasby, SE; Voormeij, DA				Allen, DM; Grasby, SE; Voormeij, DA			Determining the circulation depth of thermal springs in the southern Rocky Mountain Trench, south-eastern British Columbia, Canada using geothermometry and borehole temperature logs	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						thermal springs; hot springs; geothermometry; geothermal gradient heat flow; Rocky Mountain Trench; British Columbia; Canada	GROUNDWATER-FLOW SYSTEMS; CORDILLERA; WATER; TERRAIN; SULFATE; ALBERTA	Geochemical data for thermal spring waters along the southern Rocky Mountain Trench in British Columbia, Canada were examined. The range of equilibration temperatures for the thermal springs is between 24 and 59 degrees C, assuming that there is minimal mixing with colder shallow waters that might lead to a lowering of the calculated equilibration temperature. The chalcedony geothermometer is found to be the most appropriate given the carbonate host rocks. Temperature logs from 11 boreholes in the vicinity were used to calculate representative geothermal gradients, which range from 23.8 to 55.7 degrees C/km with an average of 24.8 +/- 8.0 degrees C/km. Using the average gradient and the range of equilibration temperatures calculated for each spring, the minimum range for the depth of origin of the thermal waters is 0.9-2.2 km. Heat flow values range from 90.3 to 155 mW/m(2), with an average of 109.1 +/- 21.0 mW/m(2). The moderate to high heat flow and heat generation result in generally higher temperatures at shallow depths, thus offering an explanation for the occurrence of thermal springs. The alignment of the thermal springs likely relates to the preferred northwest-southeast orientation for major thrust faults along the Rocky Mountain Trench, and with waters routed from depth along deep faults.

The variation in the geochemical composition of thermal waters is considered to be an important indicator of volcanic activity. In this study, we analyzed the chemical and isotopic compositions of hot springs in the TVG. A chemical and multicomponent geothermometer was used to estimate the reservoir temperature, and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were used to determine the source of the thermal water. The presence of thick andesite and fractures allowed the formation of different type of springs in the center close each other with lower temperatures and acidic springs with higher temperatures at the northeast and southwest sides of the Tatun geothermal field. The saturation index showed that the concentration of SiO2 in the thermal water was controlled by quartz. The multicomponent geothermometer indicated a reservoir temperature between 130 degrees C and 190 degrees C, and the geothermal water in Longfengku, Lengshniken, Matsao and Szehuangping may have mixed with shallow groundwater. Isotope data indicated that the stream water and groundwater originated from meteoric water, and the spring water showed a significant oxygen shift, due to water-rock interaction and evaporation. The isotopes of the fluid in the TVG are also affected by the seasonal monsoon. These results can serve as a reference for designing a conceptual model of the spring in the Tatun geothermal system.

Physicochemical Evolution of the Thermal Springs over the Siwana Ring Complex, Western Rajasthan	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Article						Siwana thermal springs; Siwana Ring Complex; Water-rock interaction; Rajasthan	MALANI IGNEOUS SUITE; NORTHWESTERN INDIA; KUNDAL AREA; PETROGENESIS; GEOCHEMISTRY; RHYOLITES	The chemical composition of thermal springs from Siwana Ring Complex (SRC) of Barmer district, Rajasthan, India has been investigated for the first time. These springs are near neutral to mildly alkaline (pH = 6.8 to 7.8) in nature with surface temperatures varying between 31 to 39 degrees C. Piper diagram suggests that these thermal springs are dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. Experimental results of water-rock interaction at 100 degrees C indicate that the thermal springs are circulating through tuff and a sedimentary formation extensively controlled by ring dykes of granites, felsic volcanics and mafic dyke and the fault systems associated with the host rock. Groundwater and thermal springs show similar characteristics. Estimated reservoir temperature suggests that Siwana area geothermal system is a low enthalpy system. Heat flow values of the area range from 83 to 205 mWm(-2), promise a viable potential for Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS).	[Singh, Hemant K.; Garg, G.

Chemical Composition and Parameters of Formation of the Waters of Some Thermal Springs in Tajikistan	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						thermal spring; trace elements in groundwaters; geothermometer; isotopes		The paper presents recently acquired data on the chemical composition of mineral springs in the Pamirs (Firuza-MGU and Garm-Chashma) and the foothills of the Tien Shan (Tandykul, Obigarm, and Khodzhaobigarm) and discusses their geological settings. The first data are acquired on the trace-element composition of the waters of the springs. The calculated B/Cl, B/Br, and Li : Rb : Cs ratios are used to reproduce the origin parameters of mineral waters in the area. The paleotemperatures of the waters are evaluated by the Na-K geothermometer at 136 to 240 degrees C and indicate that the waters were formed at significant depths. First data acquired on the delta O-18 and delta D of the thermal waters indicate that these waters are most likely of meteoric provenance, with the insignificant deviation from the line of meteoric waters caused by overprinted processes.

Both geothermal fields are carbonate hot springs containing large amounts of CO2 gas. In order to reveal the origin of the carbonated hot springs in Yaoshuitan and Qijiachuan of Xining Basin, this paper offers a comprehensive study of the regional deep geology, tectonic setting, total analysis of carbonated hot springs, delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 isotopes, main gas composition, and geochemical characteristics of travertine dating, travertine delta C-13, and rare earth elements. The geological process of carbonated hot spring formation and the evolution of H+ content from deep to shallow is revealed, and the genetic mechanism of the carbonated hot spring in Xining Basin is systematically summarized. The results show that: (1) The characteristics of delta H-2 and delta O-18 isotopes indicate that the recharge source of carbonated thermal water springs in Xining Basin is mainly atmospheric precipitation. The age of carbonated thermal water springs at C-14 is more than 20 ka, indicating that some of them may come from deep fluid (gas) sources. The R/Ra in carbonated thermal water springs is mostly less than 1, indicating that the helium in geothermal water is mainly crustal source helium, and there is no deep mantle source material. (2) The Piper three-plot indicates that the direction of groundwater evolution from the recharge area at the edge of Xining Basin to Yaoshuitan and Qijiachuan carbonated thermal water spring area near the edge of the basin is opposite to the normal path of groundwater evolution in the basin, which is due to the large amount of CO2 gas mixed in the deep fault along the northern margin of Laji Mountain. The ratio of (Ca2+ + Mg2+) and (HCO3- + SO42-) in the Potan and Qijiachuan carbonated thermal water springs is close to 1, and the ratio of (Na+ + K+)/HCO3- is less than 1. It indicates that the chemical composition of the Yaoshuitan carbonated thermal water spring and the Qijiachuan carbonated thermal water spring in Xining Basin is dominated by the dissolution of calcite, dolomite, and gypsum in deep carbonate reservoirs, supplemented by the dissolution of silicate minerals. The relationship between the volume fraction of CO2 and the delta C-13 value of carbon isotope of CO2 indicates that the source of CO2 is inorganic, which is mainly formed by metamorphism and decomposition of deep carbonate and marble. The delta Eu < 1 and delta Ce > 1 of the rare earth elements in the calcium center of the carbonated thermal water springs indicate that the groundwater supplying the travertine material has been in the acidic environment receiving CO2 from the deep crust for a long time. (3) A series of tectonic activities, such as late collision and post-collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, has led to the uplift, asthenosphere upwelling, and thermal invasion of the northern Tibetan Plateau and other deep dynamic processes. The deep faults in the northern margin of the Laji Mountain and other deep faults with obvious neotectonic activity have provided channels for the up-invasion of deep thermal materials, and local geothermal anomalies were formed near the deep faults. The hidden carbonate rocks and silicate rocks with large thickness undergo thermal metamorphism under high temperature and high pressure in the deep geothermal anomaly area and form a large amount of CO2, which is dissolved in water and enhances the acidity of water. At the same time, the dissolution reaction of acidic water to carbonate rocks consumes H+, which keeps the carbonated thermal water spring weakly acidic. (4) The composition of travertine in carbonated thermal water springs is dominated by calcite, indicating that travertine may be formed in a deep geological environment with a temperature of 150 similar to 200 degrees C, indicating that there are abnormal heat sources in shallow carbonate strata with a burial depth of 3000 similar to 4000 m. The abnormal heat source may be caused by the deep fault in the northern margin of Laji Mountain, as well as other deep and large faults channeled in the deep crust and mantle heat source, indicating that the deep fault in the northern margin of Laji Mountain has an obvious heat-controlling effect, and there is a good prospect of geothermal resources exploration near the fault.

The geological setting is defined for each spring, according to the volcanic framework of the discharge. Mineral and thermal springs are mainly related with perched-water bodies, where volcanic and hydrothermal gases modify the water chemistry. The main hydrogeochemical processes that affect water composition are steam-heating, mixing with meteoric water and evaporation. Mixing processes between thermal fluids and seawater are also important for the discharges from the basal aquifer system.											25	0	0	0	1	A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS	LEIDEN	SCHIPHOLWEG 107C, PO BOX 447, 2316 XC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS			90-2651-848-X				2001							477	481						5	Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Geological; Water Resources	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Water Resources	BT38T					2023-07-04	WOS:000172834600094

Hydrochemistry, geothermometry and origin of the low temperature thermal springs of South Konkan region, India	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Thermal spring; Hydrogeochemistry; Geothermometry; Stable isotope; South India	TRACE-ELEMENTS; GROUND-WATER; WEST-COAST; GEOCHEMISTRY; ISOTOPES; QUALITY; FLUIDS	The west coast of India is one of the important geothermal provinces that hosts many thermal springs of varying discharge characteristics. A total of twenty thermal springs have been reported in this region falling into two different suites of geological formations. Two low temperature geothermal springs located in the south Konkan region were studied with the objectives (1) to understand the geochemical evolution, (2) to identify the recharge source and (3) to propose a reservoir temperature. The hydrogeological and geochemical investigations were carried out on two geothermal springs, viz. Bandaru and Irde, both located in the Dakshina Kannada district of the Karnataka state, India. In this region, low-temperature geothermal activity has been reported in the form of the evolution of warm water from thermal spring systems with a notable presence of faults/lineaments in the geological formation. These faults enable the upward flow of geothermally heated water. The hydrochemistry of water samples was analyzed to determine the dominant hydrogeochemical processes in the region. These thermal springs are categorised as Na-HCO3 type facies. The thermal water is of a moderately alkaline nature like other geothermal springs of the west coast of India. Based on the results for major and trace element concentrations it was found that the hydrochemical process was mainly controlled by the dissolution of silicate minerals with a marginal influence from anthropogenic activity. Evaluation of delta D and delta O-18 stable isotope data suggested that the thermal springs and adjacent surface and groundwater were of meteoric origin. Reservoir temperature was estimated with Na-K-Ca, K-2/Mg, quartz and chalcedony geothermometers. The results suggest that the reservoir under consideration is a low enthalpy reservoir with temperatures ranging between 55 and 86 degrees C.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Hydrogeochemical and isotopic investigation of the Bursa-Oylat thermal waters, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Oylat; Bursa; Turkey; Oxygen-18; Deuterium; Tritium; Carbon-13 and sulfur isotopes	CHEMICAL GEOTHERMOMETRY; EQUILIBRIA; AREA	The Oylat spa is located 80 km southeast of Bursa and 30 km south of Inegol in the Marmara region. With temperature of 40 degrees C and discharge of 45 l/s, the Oylat main spring is the most important hot water spring of the area. Southeast of the spa the Forest Management spring has a temperature of 39.4 degrees C and discharge of 2 l/s. The Goz spring 2 km north of the spa, which is used for therapy of eye disease, and cold waters of the Saadet village springs with an acidic character are the further important water sources of the area. EC values of Main spring and Forest Management hot spring (750-780 mu S/cm) are lower than those of Saadet and Goz spring waters (2,070-1,280 mu S/cm) and ionic abundances are Ca > Na + K > Mg and SO4 > HCO3 > Cl. The Oylat and Sizi springs have low Na and K contents but high Ca and HCO3 concentrations. According to AIH classification, these are Ca-SO4-HCO3 waters. Based on the results of delta O-18, H-2 and H-3 isotope analyses, the thermal waters have a meteoric origin. The meteoric water infiltrates along fractures and faults, gets heated, and then returns to surface through hydrothermal conduits. Oylat waters do not have high reservoir temperatures. They are deep, circulating recharge waters from higher enhanced elevations. delta C-13(DIC) values of the Main spring and Forest Management hot spring are -6.31 and -4.45%, respectively, indicating that delta C-13 is derived from dissolution of limestones. The neutral pH thermal waters are about +18.7% in delta S-34 while the sulfate in the cold waters is about +17% (practically identical to the value for the neutral pH thermal waters). However, the Goz and Saadet springs (acid sulfate waters) have much lower delta S-34 values (similar to+ 4%).

Coastal thermal springs in a foreland setting: The Santa Cesarea Terme system (Italy)	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Foreland; Thermal springs; Carbonate reservoir; Apulia	SEAWATER INTRUSION; SULFUR; SULFATE; OXYGEN; GEOCHEMISTRY; GROUNDWATER; INDICATORS; EVOLUTION; SEDIMENTS; AQUIFER	Carbonate aquifers in foreland tectonic settings can host important thermal springs although located in areas commonly not characterized by regional high heat flow values. In these cases, when thermal springs are located close or along the coastlines the subaerial and/or submarine thermal springs constitute the outflow of marine groundwater, flowing through localized fractures and karsitic rock-volumes. This is the case of springs occurring along the south-easternmost portion of the Apulia region (Southern Italy) where few sulphurous and warm waters (22-33 degrees C) outflow in partially submerged caves located along the shoreline, thus supplying the historical spas of Santa Cesarea Terme. Here, with the aim to define the origin of the thermal fluids and their deep path, we carried out the geo-structural survey of the area and detailed hydrogeological and geochemical analyses of the thermal spring fluids. In particular, the isotopes delta O-18, delta D, C-13 in DIC, S-34(sulphate), S-34(sulphide), He-3/He-4 ratio and C-13 in CO2 were used to define the origin of the thermal water and the recharge mechanism of the geothermal system while the isotopes H-3 and C-14 were determined for estimating the age of the thermal waters, resulting in older than roughly twenty thousands years BP. The results indicate that the thermal springs are fed by marine water, having reached Santa Cesarea Terme through a localized fracture network.

J	Bahadori, D; Jahanshahi, R; Dehghani, V; Mali, S				Bahadori, Davood; Jahanshahi, Reza; Dehghani, Vahid; Mali, Sepideh			Variations of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in the cold and thermal springs of the Bazman volcanic area (in the southeast of Iran)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Bazman volcano; D-excess; Groundwater; Isotopic enrichment	GROUNDWATER; MAKRAN; O-18; H-2	The Bazman volcanic area, which comprises thermal and cold water springs with different natural characteristics, was selected as the case study of this research. The cold springs can be divided into western and eastern groups. In total, 16 water samples were collected from the thermal and cold water springs for hydrochemical and stable isotope analyses. In the study area, the groundwater temperature ranged from 28.1 degrees C (in the cold water) to 43.9 degrees C (in the hot springs). The electrical conductivity (EC) values of the groundwater samples were 1102-10,250 mu S/cm. The highest EC values belonged to the thermal springs known to have brackish water in this area. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in the springs ranged from - 5.06 to 0.04 parts per thousand and - 24.1 to - 8.6 parts per thousand, respectively. The relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 values and physicochemical characteristics was investigated. In the west of the area, the isotopic composition of the cold springs was close to that of the LMWL, while the eastern cold springs had an isotopic composition highly enriched in delta H-2 and delta O-18. In contrast, the isotopic composition of the thermal springs was almost on that of the GMWL and their deuterium isotope was more depleted than that of cold springs. The difference between the isotopic composition of the thermal springs and the LWML can be the result of hot water-rock interaction and underground evaporation. However, magma was not effective on this difference. The results showed that the groundwater of the western cold springs moved with faster velocity through the long and deep macro-pores and preferential flow channels in carbonate and igneous rocks, while in the eastern springs, groundwater originated from fine fractures with a low depth in shale and sandstone rocks.

Geochemical data of the six studied thermal springs (five at Suraj-Kund and one at Katkamsandi) show that the geothermal waters have relatively higher concentration of Na+, and K+ compared to those of Ca++ and Mg++; Cl- and SO4- (-) are in reasonably high concentration compared to the concentration of HCO3- and CO3- (-). Fluoride concentration in the geothermal waters is significantly high (18.8-24.9 mg/L). High concentration of Cl- and F- in the thermal springs is postulated to be due to deep circulation of waters within the granitic formation causing these springs to be Na-Cl rich. The geochemical analysis is supported by the principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis. Estimated reservoir temperatures from Quartz and Cation geothermometry are in the range of 116-188 degrees C. Thus, the geothermal system in the area is categorised as moderate enthalpy geothermal system. Relatively lower temperature estimates of Katkamsandi thermal spring is likely to be caused by mixing of ascending thermal waters with groundwater and equilibrating at a shallower depth as evidenced in the chloride-enthalpy mixing model. Thermal springs emanating at the surface in Suraj-Kund area have more than one reservoir in the subsurface at different depths. Furthermore, delta O-18 vs delta D plot show meteoric origin of the thermal fluids and oxygen shift from the meteoric water line suggests isotopic fractionation due to some water-rock interaction and steam separation process for the thermal fluids while ascending to the surface. Radioactive heat production estimates of CGGC range from 71.3 to 142.8 mW/m(2). These high heat producing granites are the probable heat sources for these thermal springs. Thus, it may be concluded that CGGC in the area is potential source rocks for the development of we as well as dry geothermal system for green power development and other direct uses.

Geology plays an important role since karst springs in limestone rock often show temperatures below 3A degrees C during winter. They are paralleled to the formation of ice and/or a strong decrease in discharge. In karst springs with permanent flow, temperature did not differ from springs of other geological formations. The water temperature of springs depends on thermal exchanges with the rock during the recharge process. Therefore, elevation, exposure, and permafrost location in the catchment area are expected to be the key factors governing water temperatures in alpine springs. The temperature showed a significant decrease of 0.37A degrees C per 100 m of elevation. The water in springs facing north and west was significantly colder than in south-exposed springs. The temperature significantly increased with the distance to regions of permafrost in the catchment. Understanding the factors governing the thermal patterns will help predict the implication of climate change on springs.

Here, we use a new database of discharge, temperature, and composition of thermal springs in the Alps to estimate the extent of deep groundwater flow and its contribution to the groundwater and heat budget. The results indicate that thermal springs are fed exclusively by meteoric water and make up 0.1% of the total groundwater budget. Spring water circulates on average to a depth of at least 2 km. The net heat extracted from the subsurface equals 1% of the background heat flow, which equals an average thermal footprint of 7 km(2). Cooling by downward flow and heating by upward flow are three and two times higher than the net heat flow, respectively. Comparison with North American orogens shows that hydrothermal activity is higher in areas with high relief or areas under extension.

The spatial and temporal variations of physicochemical characteristics of the thermal and cold springs were investigated for the recognition of origin and dominant hydrogeochemical processes. Results show that the thermal springs have the same origin, but due to different ascending flow paths and different conductive cooling mechanism, their temperatures vary. The chemical composition of thermal waters is controlled by dolomite, halite and sulfate minerals dissolution and calcite precipitation and bacterial sulfate reduction. The concentration of major and trace elements in the thermal springs does not change in wet and dry seasons notably because they are derived from old groundwater with deep circulation and high temperature. Seasonal change in the concentration of some trace elements is due to the seasonal variation of pH, Eh, temperature and dilution by shallow waters. Decreasing SO4 and carbonate saturation index and increasing Na/ Cl ratios and Ca content in the dry season show dilution effect caused by the previous heavy rainfall events. The temperature of the heating reservoir based on K-Mg, chalcedony, quartz and chemical equilibrium approach was approximately estimated in the range of 60-80 degrees C. Hydrogeologically, a conceptual model was suggested for the thermal springs. The general groundwater flow direction is probably from the dolomite Lar Formation in Chenaran anticline toward the adjacent syncline in a confined condition, and then a thrust fault acts as a conduit and redirects the thermal water to the emerging springs at the surface.

At least five exploratory wells were drilled in the vicinity of the KBFZ, but none were successful. Although the Na-K-Ca and Na-Li geothermometers indicate that the thermal waters discharging in the vicinity of Howard and Seigler Springs may have equilibrated at temperatures greater than 200-degrees-C, the spring temperatures and fluid discharges are low. Most thermal waters along the KBFZ contain > 100 mg/l Mg. High concentrations of dissolved magnesium are usually indicative of relatively cool hydrothermal systems. Dissolution of serpentine at shallow depths may contribute dissolved silica and magnesium to rising thermal waters. Most thermal waters are saturated with respect to amorphous silica at the measured spring temperature. Silica geothermometers and mixing models are useless because the dissolved silica concentration is not controlled by the solubility of either quartz or chalcedony. Cation geothermometry indicates the possibility of a high-temperature fluid (> 200-degrees-C) only in the vicinity of Howard and Seigler Springs. However, even if the fluid temperature is as high as that indicated by the geothermometers, the permeability may be low. Deuterium and oxygen-18 values of the thermal waters indicate that they recharged locally and became enriched in oxygen-18 by exchange with rock. Diluting meteoric water and the thermal water appear to have the same deuterium value. Lack of tritium in the diluted spring waters suggest that the diluting water is old.

J	Roper, T; Greskowiak, J; Massmann, G				Roeper, Tania; Greskowiak, Janek; Massmann, Gudrun			Detecting Small Groundwater Discharge Springs Using Handheld Thermal Infrared Imagery	GROUNDWATER			English	Article							FRESH-WATER; SUBMARINE SPRINGS; TEMPERATURE; BAY; SPIEKEROOG; NUTRIENT; SEEPAGE; ISLAND; VARIABILITY; SYSTEMS	Ground-based handheld thermal infrared imagery was used for the detection of small-scale groundwater springs at the northwestern beach of Spiekeroog Island (northwest Germany). The surveys and in situ measurements of electric conductivity were carried out from shortly before to shortly after low tide along the low water line. Several brackish groundwater discharge springs with a diameter of 1-2 cm were observed along the beach at a distance of 2-3m above the low water line. The high fresh water portion in the discharging water derives from the fresh water lens in the center of the island. During cold weather, the springs were identified by a significantly increased temperature (3-5 degrees C higher) and a lower electric conductivity (<10 mS/cm) in contrast to the surrounding sea water (1-2 degrees C, >30 mS/cm). During warmer weather conditions, an inverse temperature contrast was observed. The measurements confirm the applicability of thermal imagery for the detection of small-scale groundwater discharge locations as an extension to the established method of aerial thermal scans and prove the existence of submarine groundwater seeps in porous systems. A ground-based handheld thermal infrared imagery survey enables a precise installation of sampling devices as, for example, seepage meters.

Formation Conditions of Thermal Springs in the Barguzin-Baikal Area: Evidence from Trace Element and Isotopic Composition	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article								Based on the relations between the chemical properties of elements, the formation conditions of thermal springs, and the geologic structure of the area, the main factors controlling the geochemistry of local fissure-vein waters were determined. Our results suggest that the most important factors are the temperature gradient and intensity of water exchange, which exert a fluctuating influence on the chemical composition of waters from different parts of the area. The chemical composition of hydrothermal waters provides insight into the geologic evolution of the region and conditions of water-rock interaction. It was shown that hydrochemical parameters can be used to refine the temperature of water heating, to rank springs by the duration of water-rock interaction, to establish the relative age and depth of faults that served as pathways for thermal water discharge, and to determine the geochemical conditions of water migration.

Aims: To objective is to determine characteristics of thermal mineral waters of Ranong region and describe its classification and therapeutic indications. Material and Methods: Mineral waters were collected from Rahsawarin and Porn-Rang hot springs. All analyses were conducted according to American Public Health Association. Temperature was measured in the field at the time of sample collection. Analyses of fecal coliforms and total bacterial count were performed. Physical-chemical analyses were used to evaluate pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity. Total hardness was measured in the laboratory by titration. Metals (Al, Si, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu) were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS); major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, CI, F, HCO3-, SO4, S'-) and nutrients (NH4, PO4-, N0.3) were measured by ion chromatography technique. Results and Discussion: The mean of pH, TDS, and conductivity values observed for hot springs were met to reference value of Thai tap water standard by WHO guideline. Neither hot spring contained fecal coliform bacteria. Chemical parameters were also within standard excepted aluminum concentration. Potassium levels from mineral waters were also high. Ranong mineral spring water can be thermal waters and define to hot waters. Ranong mineral spring water can be define to fresh and low sodium water. Conclusions: Our suggestions regarding this mineral water indication were properly for external use and may concern in case of drinking.

Major and trace element concentrations in the geothermal springs along the west coast of Maharashtra, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						West coast Maharashtra; Trace elements; Geothermal springs; Water-rock interaction	DECCAN TRAPS; THERMAL SPRINGS; FLOOD BASALTS; GEOCHEMISTRY; WATERS; BORON; EVOLUTION; ERUPTION; FIELDS	The west coast geothermal province in Maharashtra hosts a number of thermal springs along the 350 km linear stretch. Major and trace element analyses of thermal springs from 15 locations along with groundwater and surface water samples have been studied. The thermal waters had temperatures ranging from 40 to 71 degrees C, pH from 7.1 to 8.8 and total dissolved solids between 337 and 8698 mg/l. Most of the thermal waters are Na-Ca-Cl or Ca-Na-Cl type except one which is of Na-HCO3 type. The major ion data is comparable over three decades suggesting a mature geothermal system in the west coast. Trace elements concentrations were low in case of some elements such as<0.1 ppb of Ag and Cd, 1-3 ppb of Cr, Zn, Co, Cu, Pb and Ni, whereas elements like Li (19-386 ppb), B (104-1362 ppb), Sr (16-13,560 ppb), Rb (13-220 ppb), Cs (0.75-44 ppb) and Ba (3-2077 ppb) were much higher in concentration. The variations in the trace element concentration in the thermal waters indicate involvement of different rock types although all the thermal emergences are within the Deccan volcanic flows.

The Troll waters are dominated by Na-HCO3 compositions and the Jotun waters by Na-Cl compositions. The 'pristine' thermal water source has a sub-neutral pH and is highly reducing. Taken at face value, common geothermometers suggest temperatures at depth of 130-180 degrees C for the Troll springs (corresponding to a depth of 1.6-2.3 km), with 10-30% thermal water diluted by 70-90% cold water. Such geothermometers may, however, be inappropriate to the cool, high CO2 waters of Bockfjord, and real temperatures at depth and dilution factors are probably considerably lower. The salinity of the thermal water appears to be only partially derived from water-rock interaction; Br/Cl ratios suggest that seawater or possibly evaporites may be a source of chloride salinity.

J	Favara, R; Grassa, F; Inguaggiato, S; Valenza, M				Favara, R; Grassa, F; Inguaggiato, S; Valenza, M			Hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes of thermal springs: earthquake-related chemical changes along Belice Fault (Western Sicily)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; GEOTHERMOMETERS; HYDROGEN	Three geothermal systems, Montevago, Castellammare-Alcamo and Sciacca, are located along the main seismogenetic structures in Western Sicily. Concentrations of dissolved species including the gases CO2, N-2 He and the results of stable isotope measurements delta O-18, deltaD and delta C-13(TDIC) in water samples collected from six thermal springs and 28 cold discharges were used to characterise their feeder aquifers and to reveal the relationships between water chemistry and regional seismicity. The Sciacca thermal springs differ chemically and isotopically from those of Montevago and the Castellammare-Alcamo areas. The inferred deep end-members of the thermal waters of Montevago and Castellammare-Alcamo are almost similar? suggesting that both systems are fed by carbonate waters and selenite waters. A slight contribution (1-3%) of seawater, during groundwater ascent it is also present. The Sciacca thermal springs are fed by a deep reservoir comprising a mixture of 50% carbonate water and 50% seawater. During ascent towards the surface, these waters interact with NaCl-rich evaporite layers. By combination of published and present data significant temporal variations of temperature and some chemical parameters in the thermal waters of Western Sicily have been recorded. These variations were mostly between 1966 and 1969. Although the data are discontinuous it is still possible to reveal a direct link between physico-chemical changes in the Acqua Pia and Terme Selinuntine springs and the 1968 Belice Valley earthquake. Within the studied springs, two kinds of geochemical behaviour have been recognised. The chemistry of the Montevago thermal springs was permanently changed in response to changes in the groundwater system. Water temperature and dissolved SO4, Cl, Na, and TDS showed minimum values before the earthquake and maximum values after the event. Almost constant values substantially higher than before, were recorded after the seismic event. Conversely, the temporal variations observed in the waters of the Terme Selinuntine spring, from 1965 to 1991, exhibit a transient increase most probably caused by a temporary contribution of deep CO2-rich fluids caused by the strain release during the 1968 earthquake.

J	Morteani, G; Moller, P; Dulski, P; Preinfalk, C				Morteani, Giulio; Moeller, Peter; Dulski, Peter; Preinfalk, Christine			Major, trace element and stable isotope composition of water and muds precipitated from the hot springs of Bolivia: Are the waters of the spring's potential ore forming fluids?	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Bolivia; Hot springs; Mineralisation; Ore forming fluids	HEAT-FLOW DENSITY; SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO; CENTRAL ANDES; SUBDUCTION; CHLORINE; BROMINE; CLIMATE; ORIGIN	The deposition of metal-rich black or reddish muds by many thermal springs in the Cordilleras and the Altiplano of Bolivia suggest that these geothermal waters may be related to those that once formed the world-class Bolivian tin, silver and gold mineralisation. The discharge temperatures of these springs are as high as 70 degrees C. According to delta O-18, delta D, tritium data and Ar/N-2 ratios these waters are predominantly of meteoric origin. Less than 10% of the discharging thermal water represents deep-seated metal-rich thermal brines of at least 530 degrees C according to carbon exchange between CO2 and CH4. These brines ascend along tectonic faults and mix with low-temperature meteoric water in surface-near aquifers. The meteoric component of the thermal water is recharged in the high Cordilleras with residence times exceeding 50 years. The chemical composition of the thermal water is dominated by the rather inefficient low-temperature leaching of the surface-near aquifer rocks by meteoric water. The small fraction of metal-rich hot deep-seated water is not able to increase the metal content of the water mix to a level sufficient to classify these thermal waters as ore-bearing. Surface-near leaching is supported, e.g., by the B/Li ratios of the spring water of the Western Cordillera and Caleras/Pulacayo in the Eastern Cordillera that correspond very closely to that of the easily leachable glassy inclusions of the outcropping andesitic lavas. The often remarkable metal content of the muds deposited by the springs originate from efficient scavenging of heavy metals by ferric oxyhydroxides. Under the given arid to semi-arid climate the muds are additionally enriched in metals by wind-transported dust. The present study does support a relation of the actual thermal waters with neither the classical subduction-related Upper Tertiary tin, silver and gold mineralisation nor the supposed younger Sb mineralisation of Bolivia.

J	Diamond, RE; Harris, C				Diamond, RE; Harris, C			Oxygen and hydrogen isotope geochemistry of thermal springs of the Western Cape, South Africa: recharge at high altitude?	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article							STABLE ISOTOPES; WATER; O-18	A number of thermal springs with temperatures up to 64 degreesC are found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The average delta C-13 value of gas (CO2 + CH4) released at three springs is -22 parts per thousand, which is consistent with an entirely biogenic origin for the C and supports previous investigations which showed that the springs are not associated with recent or nascent volcanic activity. Most springs issue from rocks of the Table Mountain Group, where faulted and highly jointed quartzites and sandstones of the Cape Fold Belt act as the main deep aquifer. The deltaD and delta O-18 values of the springs range from -46 to -18 parts per thousand and from -7.3 to -3.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Although the thermal springs have isotope compositions that plot close to the local meteoric water line, their deltaD and delta O-18 values are significantly lower than ambient meteoric water or groundwater. It is, therefore, suggested that the recharge of most of the thermal springs is at a significantly higher altitude than the spring itself. The isotope ratios decrease with increasing distance from the west coast of South Africa, which is in part related to the continental effect. However, a negative correlation between the spring water temperature and the delta O-18 value in the thermal springs closest to the west coast indicates a progressive increase in the average altitude of recharge away from the coast.

The cold waters have pCO(2) ranging from -1.86 to -2.50 (=PCO2 from 0.014 to 0.0035 atm). The chemical composition of the cold springs is controlled by evaporite deposits present in the Tawilah sandstone and Amran limestone formations, while simple crustal dissolution, coupled with CO2-rich fluid-rock interaction control the chemical signature of the hot spring waters. The temperature of the feeding system, based on the K-2/Mg geothermometer, varies between 80 and 120 degrees C. Damt thermal springs appear to be related to a 10,000 year-old volcanic activity that led to the appearance of several craters in the area. (C) 1999 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Unsal, N; Afsin, M				Unsal, N; Afsin, M			Hydrochemical and isotopic properties of the Mahmutlu and Bagdatoglu mineralized thermal springs, Kirsehir, Turkey	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Turkey; hydrochemistry; stable isotopes; thermal springs		The present study identifies the hydrochemical and isotopic properties of the Mahmutlu and Bagdatoglu mineralized thermal springs in Kirsehir province, a geothermal field in central Anatolia, Turkey. Based on these properties, a hydrogeological regime is proposed in order to explain the Mahmutlu-Bagdatoglu geothermal system. The relation between the concentrations of the environmental stable isotopes deuterium and oxygen-18 in the water is similar to the relationship in global meteoric water, indicating that the water is of meteoric origin. Evaluation of the geochemical characteristics of the water reveals that these two thermal springs belong to the same hydrogeological system. The hydrogeological system comprises a fractured limestone member of the Cevirme Formation and the Kervansaray Formation as reservoir rocks, and the Deliceirmak Formation as an overlying aquitard. The waters of the Mahmutlu and Bagdatoglu springs are mainly of the Na-Cl-SO4 type that originate from the Pohrenk evaporite. The thermal waters are undersaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, halite, and gypsum. The delta(18)O and delta(2)H contents indicate a delta(18)O Shift in the Mahmutlu and Bagdatoglu waters. The temperature range of the two reservoirs is estimated to be 98-158 degrees C, on the basis of Na+K+Ca and SiO2 geothermometers.

The aquifer rock of all springs is strongly karstified marble unit, which has a very high hydraulic conductivity compared to the low permeable country rock below and above. According to their temperature the springs can be divided into the following groups: cold springs (< 17 degrees C), sub-thermal springs (17 - 25 degrees C) and thermal springs (> 25 degrees C). Chemically all springs belong to the Ca Mg HCO3 type. Their infiltration area can be located in the mountain area north of Gemlik. By means of stable isotope analyses an estimation of the mean infiltration altitudes was possible. After infiltrating, the water flows in karstic systems of the marble unit dissolving calcite and dolomite. Chemical and isotope investigations indicate mixing processes between cold, fast circulating karstic water and hot, stagnant karstic water in the lower parts of the karstic system. This conceptual model has been verified by 2-D-quantitative numerical models. The calculation of the two independent parameters 'temperature' and 'tritium' allowed to verify physical parameters such as 'hydraulic conductivity'. A successful distinction between cold, sub-thermal and thermal waters could be achieved regarding the 'temperature' as well as the 'tritium' content of all the springs.

The temperature of springs lies between 25 degrees and 65 degrees C, with the highest surface manifestation in Bhimband. The thermal springs are issued from joints and fractures along MSR, East/West Patna faults of Precambrian quartzites and phyllites. The major ion composition elucidates that majority of waters are Ca-Mg-HCO3 type. The mechanisms controlling rock dominance origin of cations and both precipitation and rock dominance origin of anions in thermal waters are silicate rock weathering and ion-exchange processes between aquifer-rock and water. The mixing models illustrate that cold water causes intense dilution of geothermal fluids before discharge, with highest contribution in Bhaduria Bhar (76.6%) and lowest in Bhimband (55.4%) springs. The reservoir temperature as estimated based on quartz geothermometry ranges similar to 100 degrees C grading springs as low enthalpic geothermal resources. Near-surface dilution disturbs Na/K-geochemical equilibrium and thus multi-component geothermometry furnish inaccurate results. Mineral phase saturation studies depict near equilibration of quartz and chalcedony with thermal waters. With all evidences of hydrogeochemical modelling, a conceptual model of recharge-mixing-discharge of thermal springs is proposed in the study.

Due to favourable geothermal properties, these waters have been used for heating and health and recreational tourism since the 1980s. Thermal springs with temperatures up to 50 degrees C are the final part of an intermediate-scale hydrothermal system. However, systematic research on the Topusko spring area has not been conducted to lay the foundation for sustainable resource utilisation. Multidisciplinary research including the hydrogeochemical characterisation of naturally emerging thermal water, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) investigation conducted to reconstruct the subsurface geology, and hydrogeological parametrisation of the geothermal aquifer was carried out to refine the existing local conceptual model. The results show Ca-HCO3 facies of Topusko thermal waters, which get heated in a Mesozoic carbonate aquifer. The water equilibrium temperature in the geothermal aquifer is estimated to be 78 degrees C based on the SiO2-quartz geothermometer. The fault damage zone, which enables the upwelling of thermal water, was identified by ERT investigations. The transmissivity values of the aquifer derived from the results of step-drawdown tests range from 1.8 x 10(-2) to 2.3 x 10(-2) m(2)/s. Further multidisciplinary research is necessary to improve the existing conceptual model of the Topusko hydrothermal system.

Behaviour of thermal waters through granite rocks based on residence time and inorganic pattern	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Chemistry of major and trace inorganic elements; Granite rocks; Thermal springs and wells; Hill-Piper diagram; Discriminant analysis; Principal component analysis	NATURAL-WATERS; GEOCHEMISTRY; BORON; SPRINGS; ORIGIN; BASIN; SEDIMENTS; LITHIUM; BAY	Thermal waters are certainly a substantial asset of the Galicia region of Spain. They can be regarded as worth developing because of their human health implications and, if thermal tourism is promoted, their importance to the local economy. In this paper the chemistry of major and trace inorganic elements in about 45 thermal springs and wells discharging in the same hydrographical system are presented and discussed. For handling the results of all measurements, graphical representations of B/Li VS. SO42-/Cl- 4 ratios, Hill-Piper diagram, discriminant analysis (DA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. All this with the intention to classify, based on their inorganic pattern, both thermal springs and wells waters, but also waters circulating through adamellite and granodiorite rocks. The results of the hydrogeochemistry analysis showed three main water families: sulphated, chlorinated and bicarbonated waters. The results show also the presence of saline materials with chloride influence in the deeper aquifer, allowing its classification in deeper and younger/shallow waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Springs of the Gandll K'in Gwaay.yaay geothermal system ceased discharge at existing outlets and spring pools drained empty. Subsequent visits to the remote site documented return of flow at the lowest elevation discharge points, although at a greatly reduced discharge rate. Over time thermal water discharge was renewed at higher elevations and the total discharge rate increased. To understand better how seismic activity affected the spring flow, at a site similar to 30 km distant from the epicentre, a study was initiated to inform development of a conceptual model of the thermal system. Stable isotope data show that thermal waters discharging at Gandll K'in Gwaay.yaay originate in deep circulation of meteoric waters, where they are heated by the normal increase in ground temperature with depth. Geothermal gradients in the region are relatively low, and aqueous geothermometry suggests that circulation depths of the system are similar to 3.6 km. There is no significant difference in overall water geochemistry from before and after the earthquake, either suggesting that the flow path was clogged, or that changes in water pressure in the recharge zone have reduced the overall system drive. We propose a conceptual model, suggesting that the earthquake induced a drop in the water table of the recharge zone, reducing the driving force of the flow system, leading to flow cessation. As the water table returned back to normal elevations the spring system has begun to return to pre-earthquake discharge patterns. This interpretation is consistent with traditional knowledge of the site, were oral history records previous earthquake induced flow cessations and subsequent returns of spring flow.

Hard, brittle, and gray limestones Permian aged are the reservoir rocks of the HTS. delta O-18-delta H-2 isotope ratios clearly indicate a meteoric origin for the waters. The delta S-34 value of sulfate in the thermal water is nearly 4.1aEuro degrees and implies a diagenetic environment characterized by reduced sulfur compounds. The delta C-13 ratio for dissolved inorganic carbonate in the HTS lies between -1.78 and -1.62aEuro degrees, showing that it originates from the dissolution of fresh-water carbonates. Quartz geothermometry suggests a reservoir temperature of 52-85A degrees C for the Hamamayagi geothermal field, but chalcedony geothermometers suggest reservoir temperatures between 30 and 53A degrees C.

WATER TEMPERATURE PATTERNS BELOW LARGE GROUNDWATER SPRINGS: MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR COHO SALMON IN THE SHASTA RIVER, CALIFORNIA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Klamath River; spring-fed rivers; Big Springs Creek; thermal refugia	STREAM TEMPERATURE; THERMAL REFUGIA; CHINOOK; REGIME; TROUT; FLOW	Elevated stream temperature is a primary factor limiting the coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population in California's Shasta River Basin. Understanding the mechanisms driving spatial and temporal trends in water temperature throughout the Shasta River is critical to prioritising river restoration efforts aimed at protecting this threatened species. During the summer, the majority of streamflow in the Shasta River comes from large-volume, cold-water springs at the head of the tributary Big Springs Creek. In this study, we evaluated the initial character of this spring water, as well as the downstream fate and transport of these groundwater inflows during July and August 2008. Our results indicated that Big Springs Creek paradoxically provided both cool and warm waters to the Shasta River. During this period, cool groundwater inflows heated rapidly in the downstream direction in response to thermal loads from incoming solar radiation. During the night time, groundwater inflows did not appreciably heat in transit through Big Springs Creek. These diurnally varying water temperature conditions were inherited by the Shasta River, producing longitudinal temperature patterns that were out of phase with ambient meteorological conditions up to 23 km downstream. Findings from this study suggest that large, constant temperature spring sources and spring-fed rivers impart unique stream temperature patterns on downstream river reaches that can determine reach-scale habitat suitability for cold-water fishes such as coho salmon. Recognising and quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of water temperature downstream from large spring inflows can help identify and prioritize river restoration actions in locations where temperature patterns will allow rearing of cold-water fishes.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY OF THERMAL SPRINGS IN THE SOUTPANSBERG BASIN IN SOUTH AFRICA: RECENT DATA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY			English	Article							HOT-WATER SPRINGS; LIMPOPO PROVINCE; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY	Investigations were carried out in order to assess the groundwater chemistry of aquifers in the Soutpansberg Basin. Water samples were collected from Sago le, Tshipise, Mphephu, Dopeni and Siloam thermal springs during the winter and summer seasons of May 2013 and October 2013, respectively. Water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids were determined on-site, using a multiparameter meter. The concentrations of major anions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and PO4-3,) were determined using ion chromatography. Cations (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Fe2+) were analysed using optical emission spectrometry. The highest water temperatures during both the summer and winter seasons were recorded at Siloam (59.4 degrees C and 59.0 degrees C), Tshipise (51.2 degrees C and 51.2 degrees C) and Dopeni (46.0 degrees C and 46.5 degrees C), respectively. The thermal spring water samples were found to be rich in sodium, bicarbonate and chlorine with very low concentrations of other element species. The chemical composition of Sago le and Siloam thermal springs indicates the same origin of Na-Cl-HCO3 waters, typical of deep circulating groundwater. None of the thermal springs exhibited any evidence of groundwater pollution. The seasonal variations in the chemical composition of winter and summer samples were found to be negligible and consequently show that the source of the hot water was deep and therefore not affected by seasonal rainfall recharge.

The study of geothermal potentials includes indices of geochemistry, geothermometry, and mineral saturation. The surface temperatures of thermal springs range from 27 to 56 degrees C, and the pH values range from 5.6 to 9.0. The geochemical characteristic distinguishes non-volcanic thermal sources as K-Na-HCO3, while volcanic thermal sources present the Cl-HCO3-SO4-Na type. The quartz geothermometer showed that the reservoir temperatures of non-volcanic hot springs range between 61 and 135 degrees C. In comparison, the volcanic thermal sources range from 55 to 185 degrees C requiring 257 to 565 kJ/kg and energy from 231 to 786 respectively to heat water. Subsequently, it is defined as intermediate to slightly high enthalpy for most thermal springs, especially volcanic springs. The mixing of hot water with sources close to the surface can be seen by the disagreement between the silica and cation geothermometers and the disequilibrium with their associated host rocks as indicated from the plot of studied hot springs in the Na-K-Mg ternary diagram and saturation indices calculations. Radiogenic granitic host rock represents the main heat source for nonvolcanic hot springs govern by meteoric water generated in deep-seated fault systems. Meanwhile, in volcanic areas with high secondary permeability caused by faults, fractures and fractures, meteorological waters can descend to a considerable depth and heat up. In a favourable situation, thermal waters return to the surface by faults and fracture zones.

Association between physical and geochemical characteristics of thermal springs and algal diversity in Limpopo Province, South Africa	WATER SA			English	Article						thermal springs; Limpopo Province; algae; diversity; geochemical	CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS	Algal species commonly occur in thermophilic environments and appear to have very wide geographical distributions. Presence of algal species is strongly influenced by temperature, pH and mineral content of thermal waters. No research has previously been documented on the algal diversity in South African thermal springs. This paper describes the algal distribution in 6 thermal springs in Limpopo Province, South Africa, and attempts to link this to the physical and geochemical properties of the springs. Water samples were collected from Mphephu, Siloam, Tshipise, Sagole, Eiland and Soutini thermal springs and algae identified. Temperature, pH and TDS were measured on site and water samples analysed for macro- and trace-elements. Cyanophyta was the algal group most often present, followed by Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta. Some of the algae were present in waters with pH ranging from 7.1-9.7 and temperatures ranging from 40-67 degrees C. Others (the cyanobacteria and green algae: Nodularia, Schizothrix, Anacystis, Coelastrum, Chlorella and Spirogyra) only occurred in high temperature (60+degrees C) and pH>9 waters, while a number of diatoms (Synedra, Aulacoseira, Nitzschia, Cyclotella, Gyrosigma, Craticula) occurred exclusively at temperatures <45 degrees C and pH values <8. Algae were also present in waters with fluoride values exceeding that which is considered safe for human consumption as well as in waters relatively rich in uranium, rubidium, vanadium and manganese. It was clear that the occurrence of algae coincided with specific geological formations. These algae could act as indicator species of geology and heavy metals.	[Jonker, C.

The pH of these thermal springs varies from 7.1 to 7.4, indicating neutral character. Though these thermal springs propagate through the near surface layer of Deccan basalt, detailed geochemical analysis of the thermal waters using Piper diagram suggests that the water is interacting with the granitic basement rock. Silica and cation geothermometry estimates have reservoir temperature in the range of 138 to 207 degrees C categorizing it into a low to moderate enthalpy geothermal system. Furthermore, the area has high heat flow values of 53-90 mW/m(2) because of shallow Moho depth. The prevailing conditions suggest that the geothermal energy can potentially be exploited through an enhanced geothermal system (EGS). The study also indicates different mineral phases that may precipitate out of water during exploitation of geothermal energy and it should be taken into account while designing an EGS for the area.

J	Brassington, FC				Brassington, F. C.			A proposed conceptual model for the genesis of the Derbyshire thermal springs	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY			English	Article								Ten thermal springs occur in seven centres in Derbyshire, England, with temperatures up to 27.5 degrees C compared with an ambient groundwater temperature of about 9 degrees C. The springs discharge from a karstic Dinantian limestone aquifer along the boundary with the overlying Namurian strata around the edge of a regional dome structure. The water is heated by deep circulation to as much as 1 km, with the hottest spring being at Buxton spring, where the water is 5000 years old. A comparison of flow data from the Buxton spring with groundwater hydrographs shows seasonality in the thermal flows, suggesting that the loading effects produced by recharge are transmitted through this deep aquifer system. From a review of the geological history and the hydrogeology and the use of measurements on the Buxton spring it is suggested that the thermal flow system may have its roots in ancient convection cells possibly established in the deeply buried aquifer in late Carboniferous-Early Permian times. Sub-aerial erosion during the Pliocene removed the impermeable cap rocks and allowed both the thermally heated water to form warm springs and this deep groundwater circulation to be recharged by meteoric waters. The location of the individual springs is likely to date from the downcutting during the Late Pleistocene that formed the modern river valley topography.

The hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of thermal water from theQianyi well (TWQW), which is associated withthe Tongjing Warm Springs located in the Eastern Sichuan Fold Belts in Chongqing, SW China, was investigated. The reservoir of this region consists of upper and middle Triassic carbonate and evaporiterocks. The TWQW was of Ca-Mg-SO4 type with water temperature of 47.3 degrees C. Plotting on the Giggenbach Na-K-Mg diagram indicates that the TWQW was immature due to a mixing of shallow karst groundwater and thermal water. The mixing model indicates that the TWQW was composed of 49% deep thermal water and 51% shallow karst groundwater. Geothermometers suggest a reservoir temperature of about 79 degrees C, locating this aquifer at a depth of similar to 2.5km. The D and O-18 values plot near the local meteoric water line, suggesting that the TWQW originates from local meteoric water at recharge elevations of similar to 780-1160m a.s.l.. A conceptual model of thegenesis for Tongjing Warm Springs was developed. Rainfall infiltrates via karst outcrops in the elevated areas of thenorthern Tongluoxia anticline, extracts heat from reservoir rocks at depth, dissolves minerals and becomes thermal water. The thermal water is driven by gravity, flows through thecarbonate-evaporite aquifer, and follows the Tongluoxia anticline of the Eastern Sichuan Fold Belts to the southwest. The thermal water ascends to the surface along the incision created by the Wentang River and mixes with shallow karst groundwater to create warm springs. This study may be relevant toother karst geothermal reservoirs in China.

Bandung Basin in West Java Indonesia as anintra montan basin was chosen for this study. In some places, groundwater chemistry could be related to volcanic and thermal activities and may lead as the source of natural contamination to the water resources. In this research, seven water samples from southern and northern ridgesof Bandung Basin were taken and analyzed. In order to determine the type, origin of the water and potential natural contamination, hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes H-2 and O-18 were used in this research. The methods were used to interprate the mixing mechanism between thermal water and shallowgroundwater with minerals in the aquifer. The thermal water from Walini in southern ridge and Maribaya in northern ridge can be distinguished to be related with deep geothermal activities as mixing of upflowing thermal fluid with shallow groundwater. Thermal water from Kamojang site is related with meteoric water and not related or mixed with deep thermal water. One cool spring waternear Kamojang hot spring shows it could be influenced by deeper water/fluids.

Although the studied springs belong to different catchments with different hydrochemical and lithological conditions, they present some typical characteristics: (1) the water types are dominated by Ca-Mg and SO4-HCO3 main ions, with seasonal variations for the second end members; (2) the Cl concentration is always very low, and poorly correlated with other ions; (3) the circulation time obtained from isotopic data ranges between 5 and 10 years for thermal springs and it is lower than 2 years for cold springs; (4) dominant oxidizing conditions have been observed for most of the cold and for the thermal springs; (5) anthropogenic contamination is absent, while natural contamination of arsenic affects most of the springs, with a natural background level for the entire UVV of 33 mu g/L; (6) both As (V) and As (III) are present in all the springs analyzed, with a marked prevalence of As (V) among the cold ones. These conditions suggest that the latter belong to recent hydrochemical immature aquifers, where the presence of arsenic is mostly related to alkali desorption and sulfide oxidation, while the thermal springs derive from the rapid uprising of deep-circulation water, with a high concentration of geothermal arsenic.

Although the spatial distribution of groundwater springs along wide rivers can be investigated by areal thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, this technique is difficult to apply to mapping at a high spatial resolution and under riparian tree canopies. We present a real-time monitoring and postprocessing method of ground-based TIR video for determining groundwater discharge sampling points and mapping the surface water temperature. We applied this method to mapping two headwater streams in Hokkaido, Japan, in the summer. The first site was a 1.3-km-long reach underlain by Pleistocene andesite lava. Almost all of the springs were colder and had a different chemistry compared to that of the stream water, which supports the usefulness of TIR monitoring for determining groundwater discharge zones. Video postprocessing showed that cold groundwater springs were spaced every similar to 100 m, and their distribution did not follow the topography. At the second site, cold and warm springs were underlain by Holocene volcanic ash. The cold springs mainly seeped from hyporheic and riparian zones downstream, while warm springs were at the footslope. Some cold springs had much higher solute concentrations than the stream and warm springs, which suggests that the water temperature is useful for inferring sources of groundwater discharge. At this site, the video postprocessing could map not only the locations of the cold springs but also the spatial heterogeneity of the stream temperature associated with groundwater inputs.

Coastal areas were thought to have been contaminated by sewage wastewater due to a high population. Shallow groundwater is thought to have derived from precipitation because all shallow groundwater is on the Global Meteoric Water Line. There are many hot springs in the Kinokawa River catchment along the Median Tectonic Line in Wakayama. Most hot spring waters are thought to originate from mixing of shallow groundwater and Arima type deep thermal water because of their delta O-18 and delta D values. High Li+ concentration water was found for Arima type deep thermal water. In particular, Li+ concentration of Nohan No. 5 borehole, 1100m in depth, in the center of Kinokawa River catchment reached 100 mg/l and this value was the highest in Japan. However, both delta O-18 and dD values for hot spring waters did not always increase with Li+ and HCO3- concentrations although both delta O-18 and dD values increased with Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Li+ concentration for hot springs increased with HCO3- concentration. Therefore, the Li source was determined not to be different from Na+ and Cl- source.

Some populations of the species are known to inhabit hot springs. However, water temperature can be extremely high around the sources of hot springs. Thus, it is questionable whetherB. japonicaselectively inhabits such dangerous environments. To address this question, we conducted a series of observations of water temperature preferences of a hot spring population ofB. japonicain Kuchinoshima Island in Japan: (a) a field observation of tadpole density in water pools of different temperatures, (b) a field observation of water temperatures where adult males appear for breeding, and (c) an indoor observation of water temperatures selected by adult females for oviposition. As a result, tadpoles showed a higher density in cooler water. Adult males avoided water pools hotter than 37 degrees C, and adult females selected cooler pools for oviposition. Camera records also showed that adult individuals tend to appear around cooler pools. Thus, we did not find any support for the hypothesis that hot spring frogs prefer hot water. Conversely, they apparently tended to prefer cooler water if it was available. Water temperatures around the sources of the hot spring exceed thermal tolerances of the species and could be a strong selective pressure on the population. Thus, the ability to sense and avoid lethal temperatures may be a key ecological and physiological characteristic for the species that inhabit hot springs.

Zoobenthos Communities of Thermal and Cold Karst Aquatic Ecosystems (Pymvashor Natural Landmark, Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN			English	Article						zoobenthos; thermal ecosystems; karst springs; Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra	HOT-SPRINGS; TEMPERATURE; MACROINVERTEBRATES; POPULATION; GASTROPODA; TOLERANCE; NAIDIDAE; STREAMS	The summer structure of the zoobenthos in several thermal and low-temperature springs of the Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra hydroecosystem (Pymvashor Creek) is examined. Compared with cold springs, thermal springs feature a lower diversity of benthic faunal groups but a higher species richness in some of these groups. In terms of abundance, oligochaetes and dipteran (family Chironomidae) larvae prevail in communities of hydrothermal biotopes; while cold karst waters are predominated by dipteran (family Chironomidae) larvae and ostracodes. Mollusks, oligochaetes, or dipterans (family Tipulidae) feature the greatest biomass in thermal springs; in low-temperature springs, chironomids and mollusks predominate in terms of biomass. The fauna consists mainly of widespread eurythermal species, but stenothermal hydrobionts are present as well. No endemic forms typical for thermal waters in other parts of the world were discovered; however, for the first time, representatives of the extrazonal fauna were found in Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra. Within the studied stretch of Pymvashor Creek, the zoobenthos structure is fairly homogenous regardless of the warming or cooling effects of the springs.	[Loskutova, O. A.; Fefilova, E.

This therapy has been used for centuries and remains a popular form of treatment for dermatologic and rheumatologic diseases today. Although the favorable climates of balneotherapy thermal centers have known beneficial effects on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the thermal spring waters themselves can also potentially decrease skin inflammation. The addition of phototherapy to balneotherapy, or balneophototherapy, further enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of thermal spring water. We have reviewed the literature on balneotherapy in the treatment of skin diseases, as well as describing their use in three different treatment sites, each with unique climates and chemical properties of the mineral water used in balneotherapy-the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan, the La Roche-Posay Thermal Center in France, and the Blue Lagoon in Iceland.

Hydrogeochemical analyses were used to determine the origin of the water and show that sodium, chloride, and sulfate originate from dissolving evaporites that are influenced by meteoric groundwater. The circulation depths of the Aachen thermal water is estimated to be >3500 m using SiO2 - geothermometry and the regional geothermal gradient of about 30 degrees C/km. The dee circulation in Paleozoic sandstones, siltstones and shales and a considerable residence time allow rock water reactions which explain the concentrations of Ba, Sr, F and Si. While the thermal water rises into Upper Devonain limestones carbonates are dissolved. Cooler fresh water from the vicinity contributes to the thermal aquifer depending on the pressure head of the springs. Sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation can be observed as soon as the water temperature is below 65 degrees C.

The pollution related to thermal springs is likely to be encountered due to discharge of certain gases and chemical constituents from them. The chemical data would serve as an invaluable base for detecting any contamination/pollution. It is mentioned in the literature that some toxic substances are being leached by natural process from the associated rocks and soils and pollute the thermal spring water. The ionic concentrations in the spring water are within the permissible limits. However, there is no threat of any disaster to be brought about by the gases released from these springs. Naturality should be allowed for these to protect the sanctity of the springs. A comparison study of emission of various gases and particulate matter from geothermal and conventional energy sources is attempted.											1	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							101	104		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_9	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		4	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400010
J	Bozkurt, V; Erturk, S				Bozkurt, Vakkas; Erturk, Sefa			Evaluation of radon gas concentration in indoor air of spas and in spring water in the central Anatolia region of Turkey	RADIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOPHYSICS			English	Article						Radon; Spring water; Spa; Effective dose; CR-39	DRINKING-WATER	The present study aimed to determine the concentration of radon (Rn-222) levels of indoor air of spas and of spring water sites in the Turkish cities of Nigde and Aksaray, both located in Cappadocia, Anatolia, which is a well-known tourist area. In this area there are a lot of spring water and thermal water sites providing both drinking water and water for spas, which are used for therapeutic treatments of diseases and for health services. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify radon gas concentrations in the air of sites that use geothermal waters and spring water. Consequently, radon measurements were carried out using CR-39 detectors placed at different locations within each investigated thermal spa and spring water site. The results obtained indicate that, in the air of spring water at Helvadere, there is a high radon concentration. The average radon concentrations obtained for the air of Ciftehan and Ziga thermal spas were 12.5 +/- 1.4 Bq/m(3) and 15.5 +/- 2.1 Bq/m(3), respectively, while in the air of Kemerhisar, Helvadere, and Okcu village spring water sites the average radon concentrations were 32 +/- 4.2 Bq/m(3), 265 +/- 37.9 Bq/m(3), and 35 +/- 5.1 Bq/m(3), respectively. The corresponding average effective doses were calculated both for patients and workers for Ciftehan and Ziga thermal spas, and for workers 0.09 and 0.11 mSv/year for Ciftehan and Ziga, respectively, were obtained.

These waters belong to the Na-Cl water type, with the total dissolved solids of about 9847-mg/L and mean temperature of 31.5 degrees C. PCA extracted three components that explain 87.89% of the sample variances from a matrix of 35 monthly samples, taken from five thermal springs and analyzed for ten variables. Based on the results of the PCA, the water-rock interactions including evaporate dissolution, cation exchange, and dedolomitization control the chemical composition of thermal waters, and dilution by aquifer recharge creates the seasonal variation in water quality. Geochemical mass-balance modeling simulates the microbial SO4 reduction and silicate weathering and allows quantification of the evolution of the hydrothermal system. Based on the isotopic data, the meteoric water is the major origin of thermal waters without oxygen-18 shift. In addition, Chenaran anticline is the most probable catchment area of thermal springs based on the water balance calculation and geological setting. These results are quite convenient with the previous hydrological conceptual model obtained from the geochemical data. The present study highlights the importance of applying both PCA and inverse modeling simultaneously with conventional methods for assessing the origin of thermal water and deep understanding of predominant processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution in a carbonate aquifer includes low enthalpy thermal waters. This methodology has the potential for application in other regions with similar condition.

In this region, where no volcanic activity exists, thermal springs such as Kremasta and Kokkino Stefani, well-known for their healing properties occur. The objective of this study was the investigation of these springs, as well as the study of the chemical composition and origin of water. Relationships between these springs were also examined. The geological setting of the area comprises sedimentary rocks of the Pindos, Gavrovo-Tripolis and Ionian geotectonic zones, deformed by orogenic movements followed by Neogene extensional tectonism. The thermal and mineral springs were classified into three main groups. The first group is characterized by Ca-HCO3 water type and low water temperatures. It corresponds to the springs that are hosted in the Ionian zone and their possible enrichment in SO4 is mainly attributed to the evaporites. The other two groups consist of alkaline thermal water mainly hosted in the formations of Gavrovo-Tripolis zone. In these two groups, the very strong reducing conditions that prevail are expressed by high amounts of NH3 and H2S. Moreover, Na, F, Li, Sr and Ba display elevated concentrations. The second includes mineral waters of (Ca)-Na-HCO3 type that are depleted in calcium. Their residence time is rather long and they originate from deep water circulation through siliceous rocks. The third group includes thermal waters of Ca-Mg-Na-HCO3 water type of higher water temperatures that reveal characteristics of deep circulation directly associated with the underlain limestones.

In this paper, the influencing factors on groundwater quality in this area were discussed using hydrochemical analysis and the factor analysis method with 123 water and 20 rain/snow water samples. Hydrochemical analysis of the cation composition of cold springs, thermal springs/wells and sinkhole waters in the test area indicates that Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant cations, representing 73-98% of ion equivalent. The anion composition of water indicates that HCO3- is the dominant anion, represented by 73-91% of ion equivalent. Only in the No. 30 thermal spring is characterized by K+ + Na+ and HCO3- + SO42-. The P-CO2 of thermal springs/wells, cold springs and sinkhole waters decreases gradually by an average of 10,247, 3444, 319 ppmv (part per million of volume ratio), respectively. The average delta C-13(DIC) of thermal springs/wells, cold springs and sinkhole waters is - 6.56 parts per thousand, - 10.19 parts per thousand and - 13.46 parts per thousand, respectively. Corresponding to delta C-13(DIC), the mole ratios of (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/HCO3- are 0.48, 0.55 and 0.60, respectively. Factor analysis identifies 3 sources of solutes: (a) precipitation; (b) water-rock interactions; and (c) soil leaching. Ions of Na+, K+, Cl- and SO42- indicate the predominant influence of atmospheric precipitation, but the No. 30 thermal spring sample is probably the result of deep water-rock interaction (volcanic rock) or is influenced by connate water mixed with shallow karst water. The dissolution of carbonate rocks is the primary factor affecting the Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- contents of groundwater, and soil leaching is the primary factor controlling the concentration of NO3- in water. These results provide a scientific basis for rational exploitation, protection and land use planning in the test area.

J	Khater, AEM				Khater, AEM			Radiological aspects of some Egyptian thermo-mineral springs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							WATERS; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; POPULATION; BRAZIL	In Egypt, nineteen water springs with temperatures exceeding 35 degreesC, which can be considered thermal waters, were reported. The radiological aspects of thermal water in three northern regions of Egypt ( Gulf of Suez, Cairo, and Bahariya Oasis) were investigated. The activity concentrations of natural radionuclides of Ra-226, K-40, total uranium and Pb-210 (Po-210) in water samples were determined using gamma spectrometry, laser fluorimetry and alpha spectrometry after chemical separation, respectively. The highest concentrations are detected in two locations, namely Sudr and Hammam Faroun springs, which are the hottest waters in Egypt ( 89 and 72 degreesC respectively). It seems that the presence of Ra-226 is correlated to the water mineralization and the depth and the temperature of the reservoir's base. Also, these results seem evidence of uranium accumulation at depth in the mother bedrock and/or uranium immobilization due to uranium reduction to the immobile 4+-oxidation state in the reservoir base. The average activity concentrations of K-40 are dependent on the water's origin, i.e. meteoric water mixed with sea water (Gulf of Suez springs) and meteoric water ( Bahariya Oasis wells). There is no prescribed dose limit for short term and temporary exposure to thermal water. Workers at the thermal springs should be regularly monitored because of their continuous exposure to enhanced radiation levels over a long period of time. The hydrochemical characteristics, environmental isotopes aspects and water origin are briefly discussed based on published data.

Terrestrial smokers: Thermal springs due to hydrothermal convection of groundwater connected to surface water	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							VOLCANIC LAKE SYSTEMATICS; POAS VOLCANO; CRATER-LAKE; COSTA-RICA; CONSTRAINTS; NICARAGUA; DYNAMICS; BRINE; FLOW	Thermal springs are ubiquitous features whose underground kinematic structure is mostly unknown but are typically thought to originate from deep sources. We documented a type of thermal springs at the banks of a volcanic lake that are discharge zones of hydrothermal convection cells circulating groundwater within the near shore environment. The convection captures lake water through the lakebed, mixes it with deeper groundwater at velocities of 100s of m d(-1), then returns the water to the lake via the spring. The convection cell is flushed in a few hours and turns over the lake's volume in a few days. Most volcanic lakes and other relatively cool surface water bodies in areas of elevated geothermal heat fluxes meet the conditions for the occurrence of local hydrothermal circulation of groundwater. The type of spring we studied, the terrestrial version of black smokers, is likely present but perhaps unrecognized at many areas. Citation: Bayani Cardenas, M., A. M. F. Lagmay, B. J. Andrews, R. S.

Previous studies on the Himalayan geothermal belt mainly distributed in the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, water samples (8 hot springs and 1 cold spring) from the Karakorum fault (KKF) zone of western Tibetan Plateau were analyzed for the hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions. Three types of spring water along the KKF were classified on basis of ionic concentration and Sr isotopic composition: type A water (HCO3-Mg or Ca), type B water (HCO3-Na) and type C water (Cl-Na). Type A water is originated from the infiltration of meteoric water and the dissolution of silicate/evaporite. Type B water is mainly leached from the metamorphic and granitoid rocks. Type C water is formed by the dissolution of chlorides and sulphates. delta D and delta O-18 isotopes indicate that geothermal fluid along the fault zone was mainly recharged by local precipitation. Moreover, reservoir temperatures of 144.2-208.6 & DEG;C were estimated by the silica-enthalpy mixing model, and the thermal waters have a relatively deep circulation depth (>= 7.0 km). Meanwhile, the thermal waters are characterized by extremely high Li, B, Fe and As concentrations and earthquakes frequently happened in the vicinity, suggesting that the KKF is a deep and active fault, which also indicates that the thermal fluids are strongly associated with seismicity. Therefore, thermal fluid can potentially be used as continuous monitoring sites for earthquake forecasting.

This study focuses on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and formation of the anticline-controlled thermal groundwater which may provide a perspective for geothermal resources potential. The low-to-middle temperature thermal groundwater of the Taozidang anticline in the Sichuan Basin, China, was examined to estimate the temperature of the deep reservoir and identify the main hydrogeochemical processes affecting the composition of hot water during circulation and evolution. The occurrences of thermal groundwater of these springs strongly controlled by anticline are in the two plunging ends of the anticline and differ from that of the more common deep-fault circulation controlled by faults or by faults and anticlines. Incongruent dissolution of the gypsum or anhydrite of the Lower Triassic Jialingjiang and Middle Triassic Leikoupo Groups is affected by the anticline structures and results in hot water of SO4-Ca type. Meteoric water infiltrates through the karst channels and fissures at the outcropping area of carbonates to feed the groundwater. Part of the groundwater flows to depth and circulate along the two flanks of the anticline after heated. It issues in the form of hot springs or wells in the plunging ends of the anticline. Another part of the groundwater undergoing a shallow circulation forms the normal temperature spring near the hot springs. This study of the anticline-controlled thermal groundwater is important for exploitation and utilization of geothermal energy (tourism) and provides a perspective for the anticline-controlled geothermal resources potential.

J	Jawadi, HA; Malistani, HA; Moheghy, MA; Sagin, J				Jawadi, Hussain Ali; Malistani, Hasan Ali; Moheghy, Mohammad Anvar; Sagin, Jay			Essential Trace Elements and Arsenic in Thermal Springs, Afghanistan	WATER			English	Article						thermal spring; trace element; arsenic; Bamyan; central Afghanistan; contamination		Thermal springs are natural hydrogeological features which are highly affected by local volcanism or tectonic activity. Thermal springs are the best source of hydrothermal energy to heat houses and aid in the recovery of skin diseases. However, they consist of some heavy and trace metals such as arsenic, lead, zinc, copper, iron, and so forth. Somehow, the thermal springs of central Bamyan have become contaminated with some essential trace elements. Thus, this study was conducted to assess and determine the number of these trace elements in the thermal springs. To achieve these objectives, a preliminary survey, water sampling, and in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters were conducted in research areas. All the collected water samples were analyzed chemically to determine the amount of trace elements, including arsenic, barium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. The study shows that temperature ranged from 16 to 32 degrees C, while the average pH value was 6.25. Almost all of the trace elements showed an extremely high value of electrical conductivity (average: 5713 mu S/cm) and significantly high total dissolved solids (average: 3063 mg/L). The average value of chloride was 797 mg/L, which is dramatically higher than standard values. In regard to trace element concentration, almost all thermal springs were heavily contaminated with arsenic and it was recorded as 100 mu g/L in the eastern part of central Bamyan. The average amounts of barium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc were 4.14, 6.05, 1.90, 1.76, and 0.74 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, the water of the thermal springs of central Bamyan are not suitable for human consumption because of the significant amount of trace elements as well as the high-water quality index value. Using these springs for drinking and irrigation purposes has been deemed inappropriate.

J	Idris, H				Idris, H			Springs in Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						springs; potable water; Egypt		Examples of springs in Egypt deal only with examples of natural springs producing potable water. None of the natural springs producing highly mineralized thermal water for therapeutical are considered. No water from natural springs in Egypt is bottled. Egyptian standards state that the total dissolved solids in potable water should not exceed 1000 ppm, except in Siwa, where the only available source for water for human consumption is from springs that have water containing more than 2000 ppm TDS. Six natural springs in Egypt provide typical examples for the Sinai and the Western Desert: Ain Furtaga in the southern pre-Cambrian province of Sinai Peninsula; Ain El Gudeirat in the sedimentary plateau of North Sinai; and Ain El Bishmo, Ain El Bousa, and Ain El Gabal in the Western Desert Gases of Bahariya, Kharga, and Dakhla. They discharge from the Nubian Sandstone aquifer system. The sixth spring, Ain El Arayes, is a spring in Siwa Oasis.											1	11	11	0	5	SPRINGER VERLAG	NEW YORK	175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010	0177-5146			ENVIRON GEOL	Environ. Geol.

Pulmonate freshwater gastropods are widely distributed in these water bodies. Both regions, however, also possess a number of geothermal hot springs. Such springs might have served as refugia for freshwater taxa during the Pleistocene. In the present study, two hot spring systems, one in Patagonia and one at the Tibetan Plateau, were examined. Individuals of Chilina patagonica (in Patagonia) as well as Radix cf. auricularia and Gyraulus sp. (at the Tibetan Plateau) were found living in the warm water. These taxa typically live at much lower water temperatures. At the Patagonian hot spring system, gastropods occurred continuously from warm to cold water. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed very close relationships of Tibetan Plateau hot spring gastropods to cold water populations. Acclimatization and not adaptation is thus probably the main thermal adjustment process involved. Given these findings, it is plausible that hot springs have served as glacial refugia for these freshwater gastropods.	[von Oheimb, Parm Viktor; von Oheimb, Katharina C.

J	Wang, XC; Zhou, X				Wang, Xiaocui; Zhou, Xun			Geothermometry and Circulation Behavior of the Hot Springs in Yunlong County of Yunnan in Southwest China	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article							SILICA; WATER	Travertine and nontravertine thermal springs have been studied in Yunlong County in southwest China to determine the geothermal reservoir temperatures and to find the geochemical processes that affect the evolution of thermal groundwater constituents during subsurface circulation. Hydrochemical characteristics distinguish travertine from nontravertine types. Travertine springs show HCO3<bold>Cl</bold>-Na and SO4HCO3-Ca<bold>Na type</bold>, and a nontravertine spring presents ClHCO3SO4-Na type. Log(Q/K) versus T diagrams show that reservoir temperatures can be expressed as intervals based on the equilibrium mineral assemblages coexisting in equilibrium and multiminerals in equilibrium with the aid of the PHREEQC and WATCH programs. The spring water mixing ratio with shallow water is between 59% and 82% with steam loss ranging from 12.1% to 27.8%. The Dalang Spring mixes with the highest proportion of cold water (76% to 82%) among the four hot springs and has the highest geothermal reservoir temperature (132 degrees C to 176.9 degrees C). The water-rock interaction during recharge from precipitation demonstrates that the minerals halite, kaolinite, chalcedony, plagioclase, and CO2(g) play an important part in the evolution of the thermal groundwater. Four inverse modeling simulation paths between precipitation and spring discharge were established to calculate the mass flux of minerals by the PHREEQC program. Halite, kaolinite, chalcedony, plagioclase, and CO2(g) participate in dissolution reactions in the thermal groundwater circulation, while gypsum, calcite, dolomite, biotite, and fluorite keep the geochemical processes in equilibrium.

J	Luo, MM; Chen, ZH; Zhou, H; Zhang, L; Han, ZF				Luo, Mingming; Chen, Zhihua; Zhou, Hong; Zhang, Liang; Han, Zhaofeng			Hydrological response and thermal effect of karst springs linked to aquifer geometry and recharge processes	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Karst; Thermal conditions; Stable isotopes; Hydrochemistry; China	GROUNDWATER-FLOW PATHS; SOUTH CHINA; COLD SPRINGS; WATER; SYSTEMS; TRACERS; O-18; HEAT; AREA	To be better understand the hydrological and thermal behavior of karst systems in South China, seasonal variations in flow, hydrochemistry and stable isotope ratios of five karst springs were used to delineate flow paths and recharge processes, and to interpret their thermal response. Isotopic data suggest that mean recharge elevations are 200-820 m above spring outlets. Springs that originate from high elevations have lower NO3 (-) concentrations than those originating from lower areas that have more agricultural activity. Measured Sr2+ concentrations reflect the strontium contents of the host carbonate aquifer and help delineate the spring catchment's saturated zone. Seasonal variations of NO3 (-) and Sr2+ concentrations are inversely correlated, because the former correlates with event water and the latter with baseflow. The mean annual water temperatures of springs were only slightly lower than the local mean annual surface temperature at the outlet elevations. These mean spring temperatures suggest a vertical gradient of similar to 6 A degrees C/vertical km, which resembles the adiabatic lapse rate of the Earth's stable atmosphere. Seasonal temperature variations in the springs are in phase with surface air temperatures, except for Heilongquan (HLQ) spring. Event-scale variations of thermal response are dramatically controlled by the circulation depth of karst systems, which determines the effectiveness of heat exchange. HLQ spring undergoes the deepest circulation depth of 820 m, and its thermal responses are determined by the thermally effective regulation processes at higher elevations and the mixing processes associated with thermally ineffective responses at lower elevations.

The carcinogenicity potential from exposure to PTEs and radioactive elements was also investigated using probabilistic approach. The hydrochemical properties of water samples revealed that there were two different water types in the study area: (1) non-thermal Ca-HCO3 type and (2) thermal Na-Cl type. The concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mo, Ni, Sb, Zn, and (40)Kwere within the recommended water quality standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Elevated concentrations of As, Mn, Hg, Ra-226, and Th-232 occur in Na-Cl water type while elevated concentrations of Fe occur in Ca-HCO3 water type. Also, health complications of dermal contact (via balneology or bathing) are within the safe limits. The major concern regarding the contaminated springs is the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination through uncontrolled runoff and spa effluents. Preventing the spread of toxic constituents in the study area via high-risk spring water requires periodicmonitoring, and applying control measures where necessary.

Thermal springs with different mineral contents have been used by people for bathing and health purposes since old timings. The mineral water of these springs contains elements like sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium as chlorides, fluorides, sulphates, phosphates and bicarbonates which may be responsible for cure of various diseases. Chutrun hot springs have 7.21-7.8 pH, 40-42 degrees C Temperature, 300-310 ppm TDS, 3.1-6.7 ppm DO, 278-285 ppm hardness, 1.62-2.42 ppm turbidity, 250-260 ppm alkalinity, 500-516 ppm conductivity, 12-18 ppm sodium, 3.8-4.1 ppm potassium, 80-82 ppm calcium, 20 ppm magnesium, 9.6-12 ppm chlorides, 3.4-3.9 fluorides, 260-282 bicarbonates and 80-85 ppm sulphates. Absence of E.Coli and faecal coliforms indicated that waters from thermal springs are free from organic wastes contaminations. Water from thermal springs of Chutrun was unsuitable for drinking purposes due to the presence of high fluoride content and also small amount of total coliforms which may be due to the presence of environmental bacteria and non-protective measures during sampling but it was found suitable for bathing and other body contact activities.

The temperature of water recorded in these springs varies from 40 degrees C to that of steam. Some of them are being exploited as a source for geothermal energy. The purpose of this study is to measure radon and helium activity in the thermal springs of Himachal Himalaya Radon is estimated in the soil and thermal waters using alpha spectrometry and scintillometry, respectively. The radon activity is maximum (716.3 Bq/L) in thermal spring(3)at Kasol and minimum ( 15.9 Bq/L) in a natural spring ( bauli) at Takrer. Radon concentration is highly variable in the Parbati valley with minimum value of 22301+/-430 Bq/m(3) recorded at Chhinjra on the banks of river Parbati and a maximum value of 57700+/-2050 Bq/m(3) at Dharmaur, the site of uranium ore exploitation by the AMD(DAE). Helium is estimated in the thermal springs by using a Helium Leak Detector( sniffing technique). The radon and helium contents of Kasol thermal springs are correlatable with high radioactivity in the soil of the area as revealed by Alpha Guard survey in the environs of Parbati valley. The helium content recorded in thermal springs is found to vary between 15-90 ppm. Radon and Helium are well established as geochemical precursors for earthquake prediction studies. Helium/Radon ratio seems to be a better predictive tool for earthquakes in comparison to individual radon and helium precursors.

During this year indeed, numerous seismic events were felt by the local population. These springs, located on the left bank of the Vieze River, outflow from Tertiary flysch of the Helvetic domain. Since 1988, all thermal and subthermal waters of the study area were measured, sampled and analyzed systematically. Their temperatures reach a maximum of 30-degrees-C and the total discharge of the various exsurgences amounts to 1200 l/mn. The water chemistry of Ca-SO4 type with total dissolved solids of 1850 mg/l is characterized by a low content of alkalis and chlorides. The thermal springs temperature and discharge are varying with time and the warm fluids are mixed during their ascent by a cold and dilute groundwater, problably originating from a karstic aquifer in the Malm. The calcium and sulphate come from the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite present in the Triassic cellular dolomite of the autochthonous cover of the Aiguilles Rouges Massif. The authors present an hypothesis based on the interpretation of hydrogeological, geological, seismic and isotopic data, which suggests a link between these thermal springs and major water losses (> 1 m3/s) at the artificial lake of Salanfe, located 9 km south-east of the spring discharge zone. This hypothesis is supported by several observations: 1) The water losses of the lake of Salanfe do not converge to existing cold springs of the region, as shown by tracer tests carried out during the mid 1950's. This tends to reinforce the hypothesis that the water losses percolate to a deep confined aquifer; 2) The presence in the Salanfe cirque of autochthonous Triassic outcrops from the Helvetic domain, dipping towards the Val d'Illiez area: these layers are responsible for the major water losses of the lake and it is thought that the water flows in the same direction; 3) The abnormally high seismicity recorded in the Val d'Illiez in 1953 at the end of the complete initial filling of the reservoir and the occurence of the thermal springs seem to be contemporaneous; 4) The elevation of the lake catchment basin corresponds to the elevation of the thermal water catchment area, based on stable isotope data; Chemical geothermometers calculations applied to the thermal springs analyses do not indicate a temperature at depth over 35-degrees-C. Nevertheless, due to their yield (1200 l/min) and emergence temperature (30-degrees-C), the geothermal potential of the springs readily available for an integrated exploitation of water and heat of at least 1.7 MW, and should not be neglected.

Chemical analysis of waters from springs provided a set of data which was processed with statistical methods as factor and cluster analysis. Through factor analysis two main factors were identified and could be explained by marine influence and silicate weathering respectively. Cluster analysis allowed to distinguish between waters from balsalts, hyaloclastites, melt water and rain water, marine intrusions, cold carbon dioxide/thermal springs and near coast waters. Forward and inverse geochemical modeling with the computer code PHREEQC was carried out. Three flow paths were modeled, a basalt, a hyaloclastite and a thermal spring. Inverse modeling allowed to estimate the proportion of rainwater and seawater in the input. For springs influenced by volcanic gases like CO2, H2S and HCl, this input could be calculated.

IMPORTANT EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM IN THERMAL SPRINGS: AMOEBA. A PRELIMINARY STUDY FROM TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						thermal spring; free-living amoeba; Naegleria sp.; Acanthamoeba sp.; public health	PRIMARY AMEBIC MENINGOENCEPHALITIS; FREE-LIVING AMEBAS; NAEGLERIA-FOWLERI; TAP WATER; ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES; IDENTIFICATION; PREVALENCE; PROVINCE; SPP.	Thermal springs are important for community health since they are public places and being widespreadly used. Free-living amoeba are common in nature. Naegleria and Acanthamoeba species in particular are found in thermal springs and may cause serious health problems. At the first stage of the study, it is aimed to research the presence of Naegleria and Acanthamoeba species in thermal springs in Turkey while the second stage looks into the frequency of subtypes of these species by genotyping through molecular techniques. The results of the first stage are presented in this article. The second stage is currently in progress. This is the first research where all the thermal springs licensed in Turkey are included. The parasitological examination of 434 samples revealed that 34.1% of the samples were amoeba positive. Upon the completion of this study, the frequency of pathogen species and health risks linked to the amoeba will have been laid bare. Chlorination, FLA determination and typology should be incorporated into monitoring criteria for thermal spring water. To prevent health risks regarding amoeba, it would be beneficial to raise the awareness of users about hygienic practices and thwart health risks induced by amoeba in thermal springs.

The hot springs in Rehai are also characterized by a wide range of arsenic concentrations, with the highest being 1.35mg/L. Analysis of the arsenic geochemistry indicates that the alkaline and neutral hot springs in Rehai have high arsenic concentrations. The alkaline hot springs represent arsenic-rich boiled reservoir fluids, and the neutral hot springs represent mixtures of these reservoir fluids with non-thermal waters and/or condensed steam. The enrichment of arsenic in the deep reservoir fluids, also called "primary fluids", is primarily attributable to the leaching of reservoir rocks at high temperatures, but a possible arsenic contribution from magmatic fluids cannot be ruled out. The acidic springs, in contrast, have much lower arsenic concentrations because they are a mixture of non-thermal oxygenated waters and condensed steam, both of which are depleted in arsenic. In addition to arsenite and arsenate, mono-, di-, and tri-thioarsenates have been detected in the Rehai geothermal waters. The arsenic speciation in the Rehai hot springs is primarily linked to the formation processes of the various secondary fluids at the surface and their sulfide concentrations. In addition, the speciation is also affected by the pH values and the redox potentials of the waters. Compared to the springs along secondary E-W-trending faults, the chloride-rich springs along the main N-S-trending faults are generally much less affected by mixing with non-thermal waters and/or condensed steam. They are also more enriched in sulfide, and thioarsenates consequently represent a greater proportion of the total arsenic. This is the first study to report the thioarsenic geochemistry of hot springs in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different matter sources, feeding these springs, divide them into three genetic groups: hydrothermal fluid, volcanic gas and mature waters. This paper presents new data on geochemistry, hydrochemistry and ecological consequences of Baransky volcano activity including its influence on the environment. Based on tectonics and hydrogeological conditions of drainage at the volcano, we pointed out main parameters that could be influenced by the activation of seismogenesis. A new approach to calculate the influence of volcanic waters on surrounding rivers was used. Calculated values of hydrothermal weathering of rocks show the possibility of industrial usage of acid creek water as a deposit of some strategic metals. Rare earth elements study gives an understanding of the processes occurring inside the volcanic structure and opens new horizons for predicting future seismic activity.

J	Gokgoz, A; Tarcan, G				Gokgoz, A; Tarcan, G			Mineral equilibria and geothermometry of the Dalaman-Koycegiz thermal springs, southern Turkey	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							WATERS	The Dalaman and Koycegiz thermal springs are from karstic limestones belonging to Upper Cretaceous to Burdigalian Beydaglan autochthon and Carboniferous to Lutetian Lycian nappes. They have measured temperatures of 24- 41 degrees C, specific electrical conductivities of 14,310-45,600 mu S/cm, and are dominated by Na (1550-8500 mg/kg) and Cl (2725-15,320 mg/kg). The heat source of the geothermal systems of the area is tectonic related and the occurrence of the thermal springs is related to the young normal faults. Meteoric waters and seawaters recharge the reservoir rocks, are heated at depth with increasing geothermal gradient, and move up to the surface through the fractures and faults by convection trend and emerge as thermal springs. While thermal waters move up to the surface, they mix with different proportions of seawater and cold fresh waters. The seawater contribution to the thermal waters varies from 24% to 78%. Lake waters in the area are connected with thermal waters. Consequently, their chemical composition is influenced by the chemistry of thermal waters. Chemical equilibrium modelling based on measured outlet temperatures and measured pH shows that all the waters are oversaturated with respect to quartz and K-mica and undersaturated with respect to AI(OH)(3), anorthite, gypsum, siderite and SiO2(a). Albite, alunite, aragonite, Ca-montmorillonite, calcite, chalcedony, chlorite, dolomite, Fe(OH)(3)(a), fluorite, gypsum, illite, K-feldspar, kaolinite and sepiolite minerals are mostly oversaturated or undersaturated. Mineral saturation studies of the thermal springs indicate that dolomite, chalcedony and quartz are most likely to cause scaling at outlet conditions. Assessments from various chemical geothermometers, and Na-K-Mg ternary and mineral equilibrium diagrams suggest that the reservoir temperature is around 65-90 degrees C. The temperatures obtained from quartz, quartz-steam loss, Mg/Li geothermometers and mineral equilibrium diagrams give the most reasonable results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Morgan, P				Morgan, Paul			A simple model of gravitationally-driven water flow in a semicircular aquifer to estimate geothermal power potential: Examples from Arizona and Colorado	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Geothermal; Aquifer; Hot springs; Groundwater temperature; Water flow; Geothermometry	HEAT-FLOW; SPRINGS	An analytical model has been developed from which the basic thermal parameters of the flow through non-magmatic hot-spring systems can be calculated from data that can be obtained at their discharge: water outflow temperature, mean surface temperature, and water geochemistry. From this flow, the maximum thermal power potential of a system can be calculated. The model has been applied to Clifton Hot Springs in eastern Arizona, USA, and the potential power generation of this system was estimated to be within the range of 0.8-3 MW. The model has also been successfully applied to three hot spring systems in Colorado with different characteristics. The simple model is not thought to represent the details of flow in the aquifers, but provides a useful approximation of the temperatures and thermal power potential in the systems.

The water samples were taken from watershed, water treatment plant, and thermal spring area in Taiwan. Legionella was detected in 13.6 % (24/176), and the detection rate for river water, raw drinking water, and thermal spring water was 10, 21.4, and 16.6 %, respectively. Using real-time PCR, concentration of Legionella spp. in detected samples ranged between 9.75 x 10(4) and 3.47 x 10(5) cells/L in river water, 6.92 x 10(4) and 4.29 x 10(5) cells/L in raw drinking water, and 5.71 x 10(4) and 2.12 x 10(6) cells/L for thermal spring water samples. The identified species included Legionella pneumophila (20.8 %), Legionella jordanis (4.2 %), Legionella nautarum (4.2 %), Legionella sp. (4.2 %), and uncultured Legionella sp. (66.6 %). The presence of L. pneumophila in aquatic environments suggested a potential public health threat that must be further examined.

In the Bled case study, the thermal water temperature, at it is discharged to the surface, is between 19-23 degrees C. In order to determine the extent (e.g., geometry) and the origin of the pronounced deep circulation system in the Bled area, chemical and isotopic measurements of waters from different hydrogeological systems were performed (e.g., surface water, thermal water, fresh groundwater). Hydrogeochemical methods were used to tie together the above-mentioned parameters. The results have shown that thermal outflow in Bled is determined by the presence of a deep-water circulation system, where the dissolution of carbonates minerals is the main hydrogeochemical process affecting chemical components of natural water flow. The correlation of the major ions suggests that the recharge area is represented by both limestone and dolomite rocks. Moreover, the results of delta O-18 and delta H-2 of all samples indicate that the recharge is mainly meteoric precipitation. The recharge altitude was estimated for two sampled fresh groundwater springs. The isotopic compositions of those two springs suggest the range from delta O-18 = -8.68 parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -57.4 parts per thousand at an elevation of 629 m to delta O-18 = -9.30 parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -60.1 parts per thousand at an elevation of 1216 m. The isotopic analysis has confirmed that the thermal water recharges from altitudes of 1282-1620 m a.s.l.

The study area consists of a series of thermal springs with temperatures in the range of 50-62 degrees C distributed over an area of similar to 1 km(2). The thermal springs are characterized by neutral, Na-Cl type waters with relatively high silica contents (up to 109 mg/L). The present work describes the delineation of different subsurface processes (adiabatic boiling, mixing with shallow groundwater, conductive cooling) during the ascent of geothermal water towards the surface. The idea that the thermal water mixes with shallow groundwater is substantiated using environmental isotope and chemical data. The extent of dilution is quantified using tritium content of geothermal spring and shallow groundwater. The original thermal water is observed to be at equilibrium with quartz in the deep reservoir and attains its surface temperature largely by conductive cooling without any significant loss of SiO2. Silica-enthalpy and chloride-enthalpy mixing models applied suggest a reservoir temperature of about 160 +/- 10 degrees C which is in good agreement with the value obtained from the Na-K geothermometer. Very low tritium contents suggest prolonged sub-surface circulation of the recharging waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chatterjee, Sitangshu; Sharma, Suman; Ansari, Md.

The detection of crop water stress is an important issue for the accurate assessment of yield decline. The crop water stress index (CWSI) has been introduced based on the difference between leaf and air temperature. In this paper, drone-based thermal infrared image was used to map of crop water stress in water control plot (WCP) and water deficit plot (WDP) over spring chinese cabbage fields. The spatial distribution map of CWSI was in strong agreement with the abnormal growth response factors (plant height, plant diameter, and measured value by chlorophyll meter). From these results, CWSI can be used as a good method for evaluation of crop abnormal growth monitoring.

About 30 spas are located south of the Ramsar and Sadatshar town. They are almost in between 20 to 70 m elevation. Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks and alluvial deposit are exposed around the Ramsar area. In tertiary, acidic Plutonism was active and intrusion into the Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations. Quaternary and Alluvium deposits are exposed and extending on the Jurassic formations in Ramsar plain and have thickness lower than 10 m in show springs. The annual precipitation in the Ramsar region is 976 mm. There has not any proper Thermal spring management in Ramsar area yet. This could post some serious problem on improper management of Thermal spring sites, where its environment has been put into jeopardy. This study aims to provide a way to classify the Thermal springs in Ramsar area. The result of this study help in the classification of Thermal spring sites for official planning improvement of administration and sustainable development of natural resources of the area. The study makes use of the Department Applied Geosciences in Islamic Azad University and GIS data of a total of 9 Thermal springs in the attempt to set up a classification system of Thermal springs in Ramsar area. These data include surface temperature, conductivity, alkalinity, acidity, TDS, pH values, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, SiO2, SO4 contents, their locations, usages and other relevant information. The surface temperature of Thermal springs are between 19 degrees C - 65 degrees C and SiO2 geothermometer shows estimated reservoir temperature range from 86 degrees C - 96 degrees C. Most of the water from these Thermal springs is relatively turbidness and their composition is sodium choloride. The Thermal springs in this area generally exhibit high SiO2 and Na content; strong smell of sulfur. In addition, there are 30 Thermal springs located in Ramsar area and that show high concentration of Cl, Ca, Na, K and Mg. There are two major criteria used in the classification system in this study, temperature and their usage. On the basis of temperature, there are three classes of Thermal springs in Ramsar area: hyperthermal spring (10 %, 50-99 degrees C); thermal spring (80%, 30-50 degrees C). There are 4 types of usage classification: swimming pools, Tourism, space heating and drying of organic materials. There is one class achieved on the basis of pH values, all of Thermal springs exhibit weak acids.

In vitro experiments have demonstrated the effect of Avene TSW on membrane fluidity, its antiradical and anti-inflammatory properties, its effects on many mediators involved in the immune response and its stimulating effect on keratinocyte differentiation. The clinical efficacy of the water was demonstrated at the hydrotherapy centre in chronic and disabling diseases such as atopic dermatitis but also in various settings in medical and post dermatology procedure such as photodynamic therapy or photothermolysis. All these data support the fact that the Avene TSW is an active component.

Based on measurements and evaluation of chemical analysis and comparison with fresh water and wells in the study area and also the assessments of water balance, the origin of these springs is concluded to be meteoric. Upon these investigations, the warming of springs is thought to be mainly the effect of geothermal gradient on deep regional circulation of water through joints, fractures and faults. Because of deep circulation, the water is contaminated with deep seated Hormoz Series evaporites and the oil field brines, resulting in an increase in dissolved ions content.

These faults acts as conduit for the deeper circulation of the geothermal water of meteoric origin and are controlling the geothermal systems of this region. The stable isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of a few selected geothermal springs and non-thermal groundwater were monitored to identify their recharge sources. Tritium in geothermal water and groundwater were also measured to evaluate their transit time and the mixing processes governing within the geothermal systems. The temperature of hot springs varies from 56 to 71 degrees C. The stable isotope result shows that geothermal springs have absence of magmatic component and rainwater is their recharge source. It was also established that geothermal water has not undergone much fractionation because of rock-water interaction. Tritium content of the geothermal springs are low indicate deeper circulation and longer residence time of the thermal water. Lower tritium also shows insignificant mixing with non-thermal ground water.	[Deodhar, Archana; Ansari, Md. Arzoo; Mendhekar, G.

A stable groundwater supply is a key parameter defining their ecological specificity, promoting also soil thermal buffering. Still, a limited number of studies dealt with the importance of water temperature in mire ecosystems and virtually no data exist on within-site variation in the temperature buffer effect. Three temperature dataloggers, placed in patches potentially differing in groundwater supply, were installed in each of 19 Western Carpathian spring mire sites from May 2019 to July 2020. Spring source plots statistically differed in water temperature parameters from the plots located towards the spring mire margin, which did not significantly differ from one another. At the majority of sites, the temperature values changed gradually from spring source to mire margins, fitting the pattern expected in the groundwater temperature buffering scenario. Dataloggers placed in the spring sources were the most distinctive from the others in thermal buffering parameters in conditional principal component analysis. The difference between the spring source and its margin was on average 3.25 degrees C for 95th percentile of the recorded water temperature data points (i.e. warm extremes) and 1.91 degrees C for 5th percentile (i.e. cold extremes). This suggests that if the temperature at spring source area is considered, thermal buffering within a site may mitigate mainly warm extremes. Thus, our data may provide an important baseline for predictions of possibly upcoming changes in spring mire hydrology caused by climate change. Both warming and precipitation decrease can give rise to the loss or substantial reduction of buffering effect if the contrasting parameters now recorded at the central part shift to those found towards the margins of groundwater-fed areas.

Soil profiles have been laid and samples of water, algae, lichens, mosses, and vascular plants and qualitative and quantitative specimens of zoobenthos have been taken. The profile of soils in the area of springs is short and their chemical composition corresponds to that of water; they are called parasoils. We reveal 257 species of algae in the mineral springs, and most of them (196 species) are assigned to the diatoms. The lichen flora is nonspecific. Seven species are found in the mineral springs, and 100 lower taxa are sampled around the thermal springs. Six types of communities of zoobenthos are specified in the mineral sodium chloride springs according to the group of macroinvertebrates, dominating in biomass: Gastropoda-like, Turbellaria-like, Chironomidae-like, Amphipoda-like, Psychodidae-like, and Ephydridae-like. In the thermal springs, four types of communities of zoobenthos are recognized: Gastropoda-like (with the specification into mono-, two- and three-dominant), Odonata-like, Amphipoda-like, and Chironomidae-like. The thermal springs are mainly characterized by high biomass typical for eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. The species status of mollusk Lymnaea thermobaicalicaendemic to high-thermal springsis confirmed.	[Takhteev, V. V.; Eropova, I. O.; Kobanova, G. I.; Lishtva, A. V.; Ilin, G. D.; Pomazkova, G.

Hydrochemical results of major ions indicate that thermal springs are Na-SO4-Cl and Ca-SO4-Cl types. Concentrations of REEs are in ranges of 10(-4) to 1.2 and 49 to similar to 62 times of chondrite for springwater and rock samples, respectively. The thermal (STS and TTS) and the cold (APS) springs with low pH values exhibit a very high REE contents (0.64 to 3.15 mg/l). Saturation index indicates that Fe and Al phases can control dissolved REE concentration in FTS and PF cold springs. The speciation of REE complexes indicates dominant presence of LnSO(4)(+) and free ion in the Taftan thermal springs. In APS cold spring with pH similar to 4, fluoride complexes are dominate over the free ion and sulfate species, while in PF and FTS cold springs with pH 6.4 and 7, respectively, carbonate complexes (LnCO(3)(+)) are predominant species. Chondrite-normalized pattern for the low-pH waters show very distinctive gull-wing patterns, characteristic feature of acid-sulfate geothermal systems, and are similar to those of the host rocks. Chemical characteristics of rare earth elements in spring and volcanic rock samples indicate that REEs are originated from the andesitic-dacitic host rocks. Whole-rock-normalized REE patterns and petrographic evidences show that rare earth elements leached mainly from marginal alteration of minerals and matrix decomposition in volcanic rocks. In chondrite-normalized REE patterns, significant negative Eu anomaly in the cold springs compare to the thermal and acidic springs indicates that alteration of plagioclase is more intense in the later, corresponding to increasing in temperature and acidic state of reactant water.

J	Haklidir, FT				Haklidir, Fusun Tut			Hydrogeochemical evaluation of thermal, mineral and cold waters between Bursa city and Mount Uludag in the South Marmara region of Turkey	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Bursa; Fluid geochemistry; Isotope composition; Uludag; Water composition; Turkey	BUYUK MENDERES GRABEN; WESTERN TURKEY; GEOTHERMOMETRY; TEMPERATURE; EQUILIBRIA; ANATOLIA; SILICA; AREAS	The province of Bursa is located at the juxtaposition of the West Anatolian extensional zone and the middle and southern branches of the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey. Mount Uludag, which has the highest elevation in Western Anatolia, is also located in the region. The Uludag Massif, whose age is Oligocene, is a leucogranite pluton where numerous thermal, mineral and cold spring water discharges have been observed. These waters are extensively investigated for the first time in this study. Thermal waters discharge in the center of the city of Bursa, north of the Uludag Pluton, and are utilized for balneology and spa purposes in hotels, while mineral waters discharge along a narrow tectonic valley southwest of the Pluton. Mineral waters are bottled and marketed by a few companies in the region. Cold spring waters discharge at different altitudes from Uludag to the Bursa Plain. Temperatures of thermal waters vary between 37 and 80 degrees C in the area of study. Thermal spring waters have been observed of two different compositions due to varying aquifer types: the Cekirge region thermal waters are characterized by Ca-HCO3 type water, while the Kukurtlu region thermal waters, are represented by Na-HCO3 type water, and have the highest temperatures due to deeper zone interaction in the reservoir. Both mineral and cold spring waters are characterized by Ca-HCO3 type water. In the study area, electrical conductivity values vary from 556 to 1352 mu S/cm in thermal waters, while cold water values change between 37 and 472 mu S/cm, and mineral and brackish waters values vary from 1402 to 4500 mu S/cm. Investigation of water-rock interaction effects shows different values for thermal and mineral waters. The delta O-18 values of thermal waters in the region are between -10.09 and -10.87 parts per thousand, whereas the delta O-18 values of mineral waters are between -7.14 and -8.81 parts per thousand. Isotopic signatures of all springs suggest a local meteoric origin of the feed waters from higher levels of the Uludag Pluton. In the study area, the most effective water-rock interaction can be observed in mineral waters. An additional important process is cold water mixing; creating low thermal water temperatures in the study area. Thermal waters in the region show a close relationship with surface water and this effect can be clearly monitored by physical, chemical and isotope analyses during rainy seasons.

In this work, the geochemical composition of the intertidal springs is analysed to characterize the geothermal reservoirs associated with different groups of superficial manifestations. The La Posada hot springs present the highest temperature of the intertidal springs in the study area (66 degrees C). The hot springs in Bahia Concepcion correspond to the sodium-chloride type and its chemical and isotopic composition shows the incidence of mixing phenomena with seawater and probably with high salinity. Compared to seawater, the thermal water has lower concentrations of Na+, Cl-, Mg2+, SO42+ and HCO3- ions, and higher concentrations of Si and cations such as Ca2+, Sr2+ and K+. The isotopic composition indicates that the thermal water from the intertidal manifestations in the northern part of the bay lies along a mixing line of sea water with ground-water with a shift towards oxygen enrichment due to water-rock interaction. Therefore, it is likely that one single reservoir feeds all sampled hot springs.

Hydrochemistry and genesis of thermal waters of the Goryachii Klyuch spring in Primorskii Krai (Far East of Russia)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY			English	Article						nitric springs; genesis; fluorine; isotopes; Primorskii Krai; Far East of Russia		This report presents original data on the hydrochemical, isotope, and microbiological composition of nitric thermal waters of the Goryachii Klyuch spring (Primorskii Krai). The first-performed year-round surveys of the conditions of the spring water and the environment have shown that the ground waters heated over 30A degrees C in fractured siliceous Upper-Permian rocks suffered no significant seasonal variations in their temperature and discharge during a year, and the slight seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the waters were caused by the interactions in the water-rock system. The isotope studies (delta O-18, delta H-2, and H-3) have shown that the thermal waters were of atmospheric genesis and with a long-term circulation period of > 50 years. The processes of the transition of elements to the solution were decelerated at the absence of soluble rocks and aggressive gases, which caused the low mineralization of the waters. The water temperature was determined by the depth of their circulation amounting to 1-2 km. It was found that the processes of the carbon and nitrogen cycles involving microorganisms were the most intense in the thermal waters.	[Chelnokov, G. A.; Kalitina, E. G.; Bragin, I.

ETNA VOLCANO; LESSER ANTILLES; VULCANO ISLAND; TRACE-ELEMENTS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; RIVER GEOCHEMISTRY; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ZINC ISOTOPES; FRACTIONATION; CU	To trace the sources and pathways of Zn in hydrothermal systems, the Zn isotope compositions of seventeen water samples from eight thermal springs and six gas samples from two fumaroles from La Soufriere, an active volcano on Guadeloupe Island (French West Indies, FWI), were analyzed using a method adapted for purifying Zn from Fe- and SO4-enriched thermal solutions. The fumaroles are enriched in Zn 100 to 8000 times compared to the local bedrock and have isotopic compositions (delta Zn-66 values from + 0.21 parts per thousand to + 0.35 parts per thousand) similar to or slightly higher than fresh andesite (+0.21 parts per thousand). The enrichment of Zn in the thermal springs compared with the surface waters shows that Zn behaves as a soluble element during hydrothermal alteration but is significantly less mobile than Na. The delta Zn-66 values of most of the spring waters are relatively constant (approximately 0.70 parts per thousand), indicating that the thermal springs from La Soufriere are enriched in heavy isotopes (i.e., Zn-66) compared to the host rocks (from 0.14 parts per thousand to + 0.42 parts per thousand). Only three thermal springs have lower delta Zn-66 values (as low as 0.43%). While the Zn in the fumaroles is essentially derived from magma degassing, which is consistent with a previous study on Merapi volcano (Toutain et al., 2008), we show that the Zn in the thermal springs is mainly derived from water-rock interactions. The Zn-66-enriched isotopic signature in most of the spring waters can be explained qualitatively by the precipitation at depth of sulfide minerals that preferentially incorporate the light isotopes. This agrees with the isotopic fractionation that was recently calculated for aqueous complexes of Zn. The few thermal springs with lower delta Zn-66 values also have low Zn concentrations, indicating the preferential scavenging of heavy Zn isotopes in the hydrothermal conduits. This study shows that unlike chemical weathering under surface conditions, hydrothermal alteration at high temperatures significantly fractionates Zn isotopes and enriches thermal waters in heavy Zn isotopes ( e. g., 66 Zn). Continental hydrothermal systems therefore constitute a source of heavy Zn isotopes to the oceans; this should be taken into account in the global oceanic budget of Zn. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to assess the hydrogeochemical conditions, thermal and cold water samples were collected and analyzed by ICP method for major and trace elements. The results revealed the direct impact of seawater, a process which is strongly related to the major tectonic structures of the area. Seawater impact was confirmed by the Cl/Br and Na/Cl ionic ratios, as well as from statistical processing and graphical interpretation of the analytical results, which classified the sampled waters into three groups (two for cold waters and one for the thermal ones). Trace element ranges for thermal waters are: As (44-84 ppb), Pb (23-154 ppb), Ag (1-2 ppb), Mn (31-680 ppb), Cu (61-97 ppb), Cs (66-244 ppb), Se (0-76 ppb), Li (732-3269 ppb), Fe (0-1126 ppb), Sr (14000-34100 ppb), B (4300-9600 ppb). Compared with the chemical composition of other thermal springs from the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, Edipsos thermal waters are enriched in Ca2+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-, Li, B and K+, reflecting the influence from seawater. Cold waters are free of heavy metals compared with other natural waters and are characterized by good quality based on the major element chemistry. Finally, several geothermometers were applied in order to assess the reservoir temperatures, but none of them appear to be applicable, mainly due to the impact of seawater on the initial hydrogeochemistry of the geothermal fluids.

The thermal springs are a result of a geothermal anomaly developed in the Bile Herculane area, along a narrow and deep graben. In late 1970s, the Romanian government began the construction of the Cerna-Motru-Tismana hydropower system. Dams were built on these rivers, including their main tributaries, forming Cerna Lake and Motru Lake. Waters from the resulting impoundment, Cerna Lake, were directed through tunnels to Motru Lake and then to the power station at Tismana Lake. Due to this anthropogenic impact, the volume of water available to recharge the thermal water reservoir was substantially diminished. A study was requested by the government, to determine the effect of water withdrawal from the Cerna River on the thermal water reservoir and to evaluate potential hydrogeologic connections between the Cerna River, its tributaries, and the thermal water reservoirs. In 1988, an additional dam was built on the Cerna River, 5 km north of Bile Herculane (forming Prisaca Lake) to supply power, water, and recharge the thermal water reservoirs. Selected results of this study, with emphasis on the geology, hydrogeology, and recharge areas of the main springs of MehedinA i pound Mountains south of Arsasca Valley, are presented in this paper. Several sinking streams were identified in the northern part of the study area, near the boundary between non karstifiable rocks and limestones. Monitoring of selected springs during dye studies performed in July 2010 is still ongoing. At the time of publication, no dye had been detected in the monitored springs. The long residence times reflects the complexity of the geology in the area. The sinking stream and the springs being monitored are in limestone units separated by 300 m of low primary permeability flysch deposits.

In this study, we employed various hydrogeochemical methods to gain more insight into the heat source and cooling processes involved in forming various thermal springs in the geothermal field. The study showed that though the majority of the samples analyzed were immature in terms of mineral aqueous equilibria, coupling classical geothermometers with the FixAl method enabled more reliable reservoir temperature estimations. A deduction from the silica-carbonate, the chloride-enthalpy, and the silica-enthalpy mixing models indicated that the parent geothermal fluid exists beneath this study area. The thermal waters discharged from the Kangding geothermal field originate in the same deep reservoir; and the parent geothermal fluid has a temperature of about 260 degrees C, with a Cl- concentration of 1056 mg/L. Isotope (delta D and delta O-18) studies confirmed the magmatic heat effect on the parent geothermal fluid. Also, though all the thermal spring waters in the field are derived from the parent fluid, they undergo different cooling processes during ascent to the earth's surface. However, the thermal spring waters in both the Yulingong and Erdaoqiao geothermal sites were mainly formed by the mixing of the parent geothermal fluid and infiltrating groundwater. The thermal spring waters in the Erdaoqiao also had the highest levels of Ca2+, Mg2+ and TIC (total inorganic carbon) due to the presence of carbonate in its geologic stratum. The thermal springs at Zhonggu formed as a result of the "CO2 condensate", consisting of snow-melt water and meteoric water, mixing with the deep parent geothermal fluid. We attribute the absence of acid springs in the Kangding geothermal setting to the deep-seated magma chamber and a relatively small concentration of H2S in the deep thermal waters in the area.

There are two distinct groups of springs with a different "chloride-temperature" correlation but with the same Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio (0.7046 +/- 0.0001) indicating the same wall rock composition for different aquifers. Each thermal spring feeds a thermal stream that flows into the main drainage of the area, Rio Coatan. The total observed chloride discharge from the thermal springs is estimated as 14.8 g s(-1) and the total measured heat output of similar to 9.5 MW. Considering a deep fluid temperature of 250 degrees C (calculated using Na-K geothermometer), the corresponding advective heat transport from the deep reservoirs that feed these springs may be estimated as 26 MWt. However, the total chloride output measured in the main drainage (Coatan river) is 4 times higher (similar to 59 g s(-1)) than the measured Cl output of thermal springs. This means that other, undiscovered, thermal springs exist in the area and that the natural heat output through thermal springs at Tacana is significantly higher and depends on the Cl content and temperatures of the unknown thermal water discharges. If chloride concentration in these unknown springs does not exceed 540 mg L-1 (the highest analyzed Cl in Tacana springs) and the discharge temperature is 50 degrees C, then the natural heat output can be estimated at least as 22 MWt and the corresponding advective heat transport as similar to 100 MWt.

The findings reveal that the geothermal system is associated with the deep fault zone of Hasanabad and can be categorized into a convection dominated and non-magmatic geothermal system in accordance with the catalog of geothermal play types presented by Moeck (Renew Sustain Energy Rev 37:867-882, 2014). In fact, local rainfall that is occurred over the Kuhe-Bozorg limestone highlands percolates into a high depth along the main active fault of Hasanabad and then heats and emerges finally at the lowest topographic elevation of the fault in the form of thermal springs characterized by temperature ranges from 30 to 52 degrees C. The water samples from the thermal springs are of a high electrical conductivity value (ranges from 6585 to 11265 mu S/cm) with the chloride water type. The lower circulation depth of meteoric water in the geothermal system is estimated to be about 3000m by considering the possible maximum geothermal gradient of about 46 degrees C/km. The stable isotopes ratios analysis suggests that thermal water originates predominantly from rainfall occurring over the higher elevations, since the oxygen-18 ratios of the thermal spring waters are depleted than that of the cold spring waters. The equilibrium temperatures of the geothermal system are estimated via using the Na-K (Truesdell, Summary of section III: geochemical techniques in exploration. In: Proceedings of the 2nd U.N. symposium on the development and use of geothermal resources, vol 1. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, pp liii-lxxx, 1976) and Na-K (Tonani, Some remarks on the application of geochemical techniques in geothermal exploration. In: Proceedings of advances in European geothermal research, 2nd symposium, Strasbourg, pp 428-443, 1980) geothermometers are 142-148 and 146-153 degrees C, respectively, which fall within the temperature range suggested by the mineral saturation indices (137-160 degrees C) and by the warm spring mixing model (135-164 degrees C) for the thermal spring waters. Furthermore, the results show that geothermal hot water mixes predominantly with shallow cold groundwater during ascending, where the portion of the cold shallow and deep-hot waters is about 70 and 30%, respectively.

To meet this demand, new alternative energy sources are explored, and geothermal energy makes one of the important renewable resources. Inherently, the north-eastern states of India have enormous geothermal potential; however, detailed studies evaluating their geothermal potential are quite limited. In view of this, the Garampani and Gelekipung thermal spring clusters of Karbi Anglong district, Assam (India), were evaluated for their geochemical characteristics and geothermal reservoir potential. Water samples from the thermal springs along with groundwater and river water from the surrounding areas were collected seasonally and investigated for various parameters. Thermal waters are NaCl type and show distinct physico-chemical characteristics, as compared to groundwater (Na-HCO3) and surface water (Ca-HCO3 type). The chemistry of thermal water indicates long-term water-rock interactions with the basement rock and does not show an appreciable seasonal variability. The influence of thermal water on groundwater chemistry has been observed during the pre-monsoon season. However, in the post-monsoon season, the delayed monsoonal freshwater influxes seem to diminish any such effect on the groundwater chemistry. The placement of thermal waters in the mature water field of the anion variation diagram confirms their suitability for chemical geothermometry. Silica and cation geothermometry indicates that the geothermal reservoir temperature ranges between 76.3 and 105.8 degrees C. Thus a low-enthalpy geothermal system exists in the Garampani and Gelekipung thermal spring areas. The radiogenic heat production of the granitic basement rock of the study area was found to range between 2.49 and 8.14 mu W/m(3).	[Farooq, S.

The present work describes the multi-isotopic (O, H, C, S, B and Sr) characterization of thermal waters carried out in the Tural-Rajwadi geothermal field, situated in southern sector of the west coast geothermal area. The aim of this study is to delineate the origin of thermal water as well as to ascertain the sources of carbon, sulphur, boron and strontium dissolved in those thermal springs. The stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) and tritium data indicate that these thermal springs are not recently recharged rain water rather, it contains very old component of water. Oxygen-18 shift is observed due to rock-water interaction over a long period of time. Carbon isotopic composition of DIC points out to the silicate weathering with soil CO2 coming from C-3 type of plants whereas delta S-34 of dissolved sulphate confirms the marine origin of sulphate. This marine signature is basically derived from paleo-seawater possibly entrapped within the flows. Boron isotopic data reveals that both the seawater and rock dissolution are the sources of boron in the thermal waters whereas high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7220-0.7512) of the thermal waters conclusively establishes that archean granitic basement is the predominant rock source of strontium, not the Deccan flood basalts. In addition, like strontium, concentrations of lithium, rubidium and caesium are also governed by the rock-water interaction. Thus, the combined use of this multi-isotope technique coupled with trace element concentrations proves to be an effective tool to establish the sources of solutes in the thermal water.

Based on the samples collected from the Rehai geothermal field, southwestern China and the data from published literature, this study revealed that there are apparently differences in general hydrochemistry and REE geochemistry characteristics between the acidic and alkaline springs. The content of REE in acidic springs is one to three orders of magnitude higher than that of alkaline springs and river water. The NASC-normalized REE patterns of acidic springs are more similar to river water and volcanic rocks, but heavy rare earth elements (HREE) in all samples are enriched compared with volcanic rocks. Moreover, the most remarkable characteristic is that the total concentration of REE decreases significantly with the increase in pH of the springs, but rises slightly after water becomes neutral. Through speciation calculations, major REE species are Ln3+ and LnSO4+ in acidic springs (Ln represents REE), and REE hydroxide complexes are predominant in alkaline springs. The behaviors of REE in thermal springs are controlled by three processes: (i) the dissolution and alteration of primary minerals containing REE vary with the pH of water. The co-alteration of the whole-rock minerals contribute to the REE in the acidic springs, whereas the dissolution of feldspar is main source of REE in the alkaline springs; (ii) the content and species of Fe and Mn affects the adsorption, desorption and co-precipitation of REE, especially under weakly alkaline conditions; and (iii) inorganic complexation and adsorption are responsible for the fractionation between LREE and HREE. The positive Eu anomaly is mainly owing to preferential dissolution of feldspar in alkaline springs. Combined with the general hydrochemistry of thermal springs, isotopic data and inverse geochemical modeling, acidic springs in the Rehai geothermal field generate from oxidized shallow water heated by steam containing H2S, and alkaline springs are derived from deep geothermal water.

Interestingly, independent scientific examinations studying the effect of spa waters are scarce. Objective: In the present in vitro study, we compared the effect of culture media supplemented with (a) thermal spa waters (La Roche-Posay, Avene) and (b) two natural mineral drinking waters (Heppinger, Adelholzener) on physiological parameters in HaCaT keratinocytes. Methods: The different medium preparations were investigated with regard to cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, the impact on inflammation parameters with and without ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation was examined. Results: Two popular thermal spring waters were found to suppress cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, these waters reversed the induction of interleukin-6, as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and promoter transactivation, and the formation of reactive oxygen species after UVB stimulation. Of note, the two natural mineral waters, which are distributed as drinking waters, had some effect on the above-mentioned parameters but to a lesser extent. Conclusion: In summary, our results show that spa waters, and particularly those derived from thermal springs, reduce parameters associated with inflammation. It seems likely that trace elements such as selenium and zinc are critical for the observed effects.

Temporal changes in the composition of the principal spring (Banos Viejos) indicate that a small degree of mixing may occur between deep thermal waters and shallow groundwater. Slight compositional variations also occur between the various thermal springs in the study area. These spatial variations are due to the different local hydrodynamic conditions in the springs. Towards the north in less hydraulically transmissive rocks, cooling of the rising water is more noticeable, as are ion exchange and processes of SO4 reduction. The chemical composition of the water is related to the dissolution of evaporites (SO4 and Cl salts), carbonates and silicates, and to the possible existence of sources of S within the rock. Estimates of the mean residence times have been obtained based on C-14(DIC) and T. The state of thermodynamic equilibrium at the spring discharge was calculated using the SOLMINEQ.88 program. The results indicate that all the samples are supersaturated with respect to quartz. chalcedony, cristobalite, calcite, aragonite and dolomite, and undersaturated with respect: to gypsum, anhydrite and halite. The use of different geothermometers and modelling of saturation indices for quartz, albite and anhydrite indicate temperatures of about 110 degreesC. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Colca River basin in S Peru is a highly diversified and complex thermal region with unresolved questions on the origin of thermal fluids, reservoir temperature, and connections with tectonic and/or volcanic activity. To answer these, we used hydrogeochemical analysis of 35 water samples from springs and geysers, together with isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D) analysis, chemical and mineral studies of precipitates collected in the field around these outflows, and field observations. We aimed (1) to recognize the geochemistry of thermal waters and precipitates in the central part of the Colca River basin, (2) to identify fluid sources and their origin, (3) to estimate the temperature of a potential geothermal reservoir, and (4) to discuss the regional active tectonic and volcanic framework of this geothermal region and mutual relationships.Our results corroborate a heterogeneous and complex geothermal system in the central part of the Colca River basin, with contrasting hydrogeochemical and physical properties, variable isotope composition, different reservoir temperatures, and associated precipitates around thermal springs. Processes controlling water chemistry are closely related to the Ampato-Sabancaya magmatic chamber's activity and tectonic structures that allow complex interactions of meteoric waters with magmatic fluids and gases. With a considerable gradient of pressure owing to local relief and deep incision in the Colca Canyon, these processes led to the differentiation of the thermal waters into three main groups. (1) Chloride-rich, mainly sodium chloride, thermal waters are of meteoric origin but mature within the geothermal reservoir possibly fed by magma degassing. These waters' chemical and isotopic composition results from water-rock interaction and mixing with magmatic waters within the reservoir. These waters discharge at the bottom of the Colca Canyon and Valley, presenting a broad hydrogeochemical spectrum and highly variable mineral phases precipitating at the outflows. The reservoir temperature estimated for these waters ranges from 180 to 200 ?degrees C. The group of hottest springs and geysers at the bottom of the Colca Canyon waters are fully equilibrated, with the reservoir temperature similar to 240 ?degrees C. (2) Sulfate-rich waters are shallow meteoric waters heated by ascending gases that form an independent group referring to the local water circulation, often controlled by tectonic barriers. (3) Bicarbonate-rich waters are the intermediate meteoric waters, divided into two hydrochemical groups: waters partially equilibrated with reservoir rocks and more similar to chloride-rich waters or additionally enriched with SO4 and more similar to sulfate-rich waters.Studied thermal springs show a clear spatial correlation with active and seismogenic crustal W- to NW-tracing normal and strike-slip faults. These act as barriers to infiltrating meteoric waters, provide pathways to hydrothermal solutions and gases assisting in meteoric water heating, and yield passages for pressured by lithostatic load and heated waters to ascend to the surface.

Ammonium in thermal waters of Yellowstone National Park: Processes affecting speciation and isotope fractionation	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							NITRIC-OXIDE; NITROGEN; GEOCHEMISTRY; QUANTIFICATION; DISCHARGES; SUBDUCTION; ORIGIN; ROCKS	Dissolved inorganic nitrogen, largely in reduced form (NH4(T) approximate to NH4(aq)+ + NH3(aq)degrees), has been documented in thermal waters throughout Yellowstone National Park, with concentrations ranging from a few micromolar along the Firehole River to millimolar concentrations at Washburn Hot Springs. Indirect evidence from rock nitrogen analyses and previous work on organic compounds associated with Washburn Hot Springs and the Mirror Plateau indicate multiple sources for thermal water NH4(T), including Mesozoic marine sedimentary rocks, Eocene lacustrine deposits, and glacial deposits. A positive correlation between NH4(T) concentration and delta O-18 of thermal water indicates that boiling is an important mechanism for increasing concentrations of NH4(T) and other solutes in some areas. The isotopic composition of dissolved NH4(T) is highly variable (delta N-15= -6 parts per thousand to + 30 parts per thousand) and is positively correlated with pH values. In comparison to likely delta N-15 values of nitrogen source materials (+ 1 parts per thousand to + 7 parts per thousand), high delta N-15 values in hot springs with pH > 5 are attributed to isotope fractionation associated with NH3(aq)degrees loss by volatilization. NH4(T) in springs with low pH typically is relatively unfractionated, except for some acid springs with negative delta N-15 values that are attributed to NH3(g)degrees condensation. NH4(T) concentration and isotopic variations were evident spatially (between springs) and temporally (in individual springs). These variations are likely to be reflected in biomass and sediments associated with the hot springs and outflows. Elevated NH4(T) concentrations can persist for 10s to 1000s of meters in surface waters draining hot spring areas before being completely assimilated or oxidized. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Characterization of a Pleistocene thermal spring in Mozambique	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						East African rift system; Geothermal spring; Hydrochemistry; Fractured rocks; Mozambique		A hydrogeological study was conducted with the objective to investigate the only currently known hot spring of Sofala Province in Mozambique with respect to the origin of the water, the discharge, and its chemical composition. Field investigations comprised a general land use survey, mapping of sediment and water temperatures, discharge measurements and on-site water chemistry as well as sampling for further chemical analyses and groundwater dating. Thermal water discharge occurs along a 100 m long NE-SW zone with water temperatures ranging from 42 to 64.5C. The thermal water is a low-mineralized sodium-chloride-sulfate water enriched in phosphate, fluorine and nickel. The silica geothermometer, the silica concentration of 43 mg/kg and the ratios of Br/Cl and I/Cl of 2.5 x 10(-3), suggest that the thermal water stems from approximately 5,000 m depth and had a long residence time with silicate rocks. This points towards Gorongosa Mountain as the water source area. 14C dating suggests a groundwater age of 11,000 years.

The survey was carried out to study the naturally occurring radionuclides in the popular region of thermal waters, Olovo and Sarajevo. The content of uranium isotopes and gross alpha,beta-activity of thermal waters were determined in order to estimate the radiological status of thermal water and the influence of the soil and rock composition on the examined parameters. The content of uranium isotopes was determined by alpha-ray spectrometry according to Eichrom [1] and HASL-300 [2] procedures. Measurements of activity concentrations in water samples were performed on the basis of ISO standards [3, 4]. According to the results obtained, the analyzed water is radiologically valid and, according to the current legislation on water radioactivity (WHO), is not harmful to human health and environment.

Thermal waters with temperatures ranging from 28.7 to 52 degrees C vary in chemical composition and TDS contents. Those waters generally are enriched in Na-Cl-HCO3 and suggest deep water circulation. Chemistry of all of the water samples are graphed in the Cl-SO4-HCO3 ternary diagram. There is a trend of mixing along a line of constituent proportions between recently recharged water and older water. The trend toward the chloride corner is mainly the result of contact in the subsurface with evaporite-bearing formations and/or mixing with brines. Relatively high concentrations of Na, Ca, K, Cl, and SO4 resulted from rock/water interactions. These hot spring waters show high concentrations of arsenic (0.14-0.95 mg L-1). The diffusion of As-bearing spring waters into shallow aquifers could contaminate the groundwater which is used for drinking purposes. Also discharges of this As-enriched water into streams and rivers could affect irrigated crops in downstream fields. In both cases, the health of local residents could be at risk.

Its regional geology is characterized by step-faulted metamorphosed Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments partly intruded by igneous rocks. Two geothermal anomalies, heating groundwater to more than 40 degrees C at 100 m below the surface, are tied to horst-like basement uplifts along deep-reaching faults. Inorganic carbon dissolved in thermal waters of the region is isotopically rather heavy, indicating an endogenic origin. In spite of the considerable variation, delta(18) does not allow differentiation of thermal and non-thermal waters. It does not agree with the isotopic pattern of recently recharged groundwaters. delta(13)C in fossil spring deposits of tufa towers and bedded travertines indicates a derivation from endogenic CO2 similar to that dissolved in present thermal waters. In contrast, their delta(18)O is remarkably high, suggesting evaporated basin waters as a possible source.

Together with the results of short- and long-time leaching of local rocks, REE and Y and Pb isotope ratios indicate that the Palaeozoic mica schists dominantly control the REE and Y signatures of the deep-seated Na-HCO3 waters. Marbles may also be involved, but their low REE contribution is overridden by the much higher REE and Y abundances in the mica schists. Palaeozoic gneisses can be excluded as source rocks by both Pb isotope ratios and REE leaching behaviour. The deep-seated waters either ascend rapidly in production wells and precipitate carbonate-silica scales at temperatures of about 200 degreesC or these waters ascend slowly to springs, become enriched in Ca2+, Cl- and SO42-, and discharge with temperatures up to 100 degreesC as fumaroles or hot springs. Some of these spring waters precipitate large amounts of travertine upon exsolution Of CO2. In contrast, the thermal Ca-HCO3-type of water from Pamukkale has its source in the regional Pliocene limestones. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of thermal springs in the eastern Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Thermal spring water; hydrochemistry; geothermometry; isotopes; Mexico	CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; HEAT-FLOW; WATERS; EVOLUTION; MICHOACAN; EQUILIBRIA; FIELD; GROUNDWATER; ISOTOPES; ANATOLIA	This study was aimed at investigating the hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of low-temperature hydrothermal springs in six study sites located in the eastern portion of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, in order to evaluate the source of the thermal water, rock-water interactions, and reservoir temperature. In addition, based on this, possible similarities and differences among these thermal springs were explored. Samples of thermal waters (12 samples) and non-thermal waters (6 samples) were collected during dry and rainy seasons. Stable isotopes (18O, 2H) as well as major, minor, and trace ions were analyzed for, and saturation indices and reservoir temperatures were estimated. Thermal water temperatures ranged from 33 to 55 degrees C and the pH was slightly acid (and slightly basic in only one case). The electrical conductivity ranged widely, from 0.2 to 27 mS/ cm, although most samples had > 8 mS/cm. Using a Piper diagram, three hydrochemical facies were identified: Na-Cl, Na-Ca-SO4-HCO3, and Na-HCO3. The notable minor and trace elements and ions were B, Li, As, and F- . 818O and 82H values plot very close to the meteoric water line, although samples from three of the study sites showed a possible isotope exchange between water and minerals at high temperatures. By estimating reservoir temperatures using solute geothermometers and saturation indices, it was possible to determine similarity among the values obtained (90 to 190 degrees C). These data indicate that the hydrochemistry of the thermal waters reflects a water source that is related to geothermal brines in some cases, and with the mixing of a thermal fluid and a recently infiltrated water in other cases, as well as water-rock interactions (mostly with silicates) and carbonate precipitation.

They contain certain degree of natural radioactivity attributable to the elements of the uranium and thorium natural decay series. Among these elements, the most radiotoxic and the most important is radium that exists in several isotopic forms (Ra-226 and Ra-228). The focus of attention was the content of radium in samples of thermal and mineral spring water from several spas in Croatia. These waters are mainly used for medical, bathing and recreational purposes, and some of them are used for drinking. Measured activity concentrations of Ra-226 ranged from 87 to 6200 mBq l(-1) which, in some springs, exceed the maximal permissible level of 1 Bq l(-1) for drinking water. Measured activity concentrations of Ra-228 ranged from 23 to 3480 mBq l(-1). The study showed that radium content for the investigated thermal and mineral waters is below the levels at which negative consequences would arise due to ingestion.

The objects of our study are volcanic springs from the Kamchatka and Kuril islands (Russia). The results of hydrochemistry, geophysical study and physicochemical modeling show that contrasting types of thermal waters can be originated from a single magmatogene fluid. The geometrical zoning of the thermal subsurface zone has been obtained and phase barriers were located using frequency electric sounding. We developed a new software package which allows us to take into account the dynamics of thermo-physical and chemical parameters. The obtained results show that the occurrence of phase barriers on the pathways of ascending fluids represents the decisive factor controlling variations in thermal spring's composition.

They are natural phenomena. Different terminology has been assigned to the thermal springs depending upon the nature of manifestation. A thermal spring is considered as one of the non-conventional source of energy. Exploration and utilization of this source has become vital to achieve better economy in the long run for the country. In fact the geothermal energy is preferred because it is perennial, inexhaustible and pollution free. Thermal springs are documented throughout the world. They are usually observed in and around tectonic zones and often associated with volcanic activity. In India, thermal springs are observed around specific tectonic system and predominantly traced in Himalayan mountain ranges and have been grouped into specific geothermal provinces. The thermal springs of Odisha are located in the tectonic zones such as (i) Mahanadi graben and (ii) Precambrian mega lineaments. These springs are not directly related to any igneous activity. Description on thermal springs of India in general and Odisha in particular are available in published literature. Present work includes geological, hydrological and geochemical characteristics of all the eight thermal springs of Odisha. Further discussions on their manifold uses and a genetic model have also been attempted.											38	0	0	0	3	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							1	12		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_1	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		12	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400002

This research focused on exposure to the high concentration of fluoride in the springs water in the Bazman volcanic area, southeast Iran. The combination of chemical/isotopic analysis, geochemical modeling, health risk assessment and multivariate statistical methods were applied to investigate the contamination and sources of fluoride in the samples. Groundwater samples were collected from cold and thermal springs. Major ions, fluoride, trace elements and stable isotopes delta O-18 and 8D were measured in the samples using standard methods, ICP-MS and OA-ICOS, respectively. Fluoride content in springs varied from 0.5 to 3.75 mg/L with an average value of 1.66 mg/L. The highest fluoride concentrations were observed in the eastern cold springs while thermal springs showed the minimum fluoride contents. The majority of samples showed F contents higher than the calculated optimal concentration of fluoride (0.75 mg/L). Reaction of fluorite mineral with HCO3 and replacement of F in clay minerals and metal oxy-hydroxides with OH in water were likely cause fluoride enrichment in the eastern springs. Whereas, in the western springs and thermal springs, origin of fluoride was related to weathering of muscovite, cryolite, apatite and fluoroapatite minerals. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 of the water samples displayed the impact on evaporation on fluoride enrichment in all spring water samples. The average value of contamination index (C-d) in the water samples was 1.94 categorizing medium risk level while springs S7, S8, S9 and S4 were above the threshold value of Cd index. The fluoride hazard quotient (HQ) showed that 25%, 44%, 56% and 0% of springs' water resources had high risk level for age group of adults, teenager, children and infants, respectively. Therefore, health risk of fluoride in drinking water resources were in the following order: children > teenager > adults > infants.

Water temperature at the emergency varies between 18 and 57 degrees C and total dissolved solids (TDS) range from 1,742 to 18,542 mg/l. Hydrochemical approach recognized three different water types: (1) the poorly mineralized Ca-HCO3-SO42+ type characterizing the carbonate aquifer, (2) the mixed type influenced by the evaporate rocks, and (3) the highly mineralized Na-Cl- type representing the deep thermal waters. Furthermore, the estimated temperatures at depth, using various chemical geothermometers, range between 60 and 110 degrees C. A synthetic hydrogeothermal approach, applied on the study area, including hydrogeological, geological, hydrochemical, and geothermometrical data shows that the thermal water of Northeast Tunisia is of meteoric origin. This water infiltrates deeply into the Jurassic dolomite and reaches a high temperature before rising upwards to supply the hot springs and well discharge zones. The upward movement of hot water from the deep aquifers to the surface is essentially due to the tectonic disharmonies which affected the area.

In this study, for the first time, the possible antiviral aspects of mineral nanoparticles (MNPs) obtained from a natural source, thermal spring water, were evaluated.Methods: At first, MNPs obtained from the Gishki thermal spring, Kerman province, Iran, were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Then, the presence of mineral elements in MNPs was identified by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and MTT assay. Finally, 17 cases suspected of COVID-19 were randomly selected, and their nasal swab samples were exposed to two concentrations of MNPs (50 and 100 u/mL).Results: The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test manifested that MNPs had a destructive effect on 4 (33%) COVID-19 cases.Conclusion: Therefore, MNPs of thermal spring water may act as an obstacle against COVID-19.

The water chemistry of these thermal springs namely Tapovan, Bhenti, Darr, Shefa, Devibagar and Pangla attributes that they originate from different reservoirs. The silica thermometry reveals temperatures of their reservoir between 80 and 129 degrees C, whereas the alkali thermometry provides unusual high reservoir temperatures. The water chemistry and delta O-18 parts per thousand signatures imply involvement of chemically immature, meteoric water in their formation, and therefore application of alkali thermometry is unsuitable for estimation of their reservoir temperatures. The delta S-34 parts per thousand values of the sulphur in the precipitates found at the aperture of some of these springs indicate a magmatic origin, however matching values of delta S-34 parts per thousand obtained for the sulphides present in the adjoining area suggest that sulphur is likely derived from these sulphide minerals. The study invokes that the thermal water springs around CCB are evolved by heating of the percolating meteoric water in high geothermal gradient, their water-rock interaction is not well-defined and the sulphur in their precipitate is derived from the sulphide minerals present in the area.

These springs are hosted by Deccan Trap volcanic basalt cover of Cretaceous-Paleocene age (similar to 65 Ma). We investigate the geochemistry of the hot springs and geophysical data to evaluate the geothermal system and understand the factors responsible for the ascent of the hot water to the surface. For this, we use twenty-two water samples collected in and around thermal springs to analyze the geothermal geochemistry. Our study reveals that the thermal waters circulate through a granite basement with source temperatures of 117-140 degrees C, 90 degrees C, and 85-93 degrees C for Tural-Rajwadi, Aravali, and Unhavre, respectively. Further, results of the state-of-art techniques applied to gravity data reveal that these hot springs are aligned along a regional and deep-seated NNW-SSE and E-W fault system at the crustal level (>= 12 km).

Within the same time interval more than 150 earthquakes with 3.5 < M < 5.3 occurred in the area. The data display several anomalies in Cl, SO4, delta D and delta O-18, always immediately after an event, with a relaxation time of 3 - 4 weeks. The responses occurred only with earthquakes having an estimated epicentral site very close or almost coincident with the location of a spring. These results indicate that: 1) at least for earthquakes with M < 5.3 within the Guerrero "seismic gap" there were no precursors in the chemical (ionic) and isotopic composition of thermal waters (on the weekly basis); 2) two groups of springs near Acapulco, Dos Arroyos and Paso Real, are sensitive to seismic activity and therefore further monitoring of these springs may help to unravel the mechanisms of the "hydro-seismo-interaction" in the area.

Hydrogels with two spring waters and two clay excipients, sepiolite (PS9) and palygorskite (G30), were studied. The excipients were fully characterized as regards their identity, purity and richness, as well as their textural features, cation exchange capacities and zeta-potential. Conductivity, pH and ionic composition of spring waters were also assessed. Rheological and thermal properties of hydrogels were monitored through time. PS9 complied with identity, richness and purity descriptions of "Magnesium silicate" (or "Magnesium trisilicate") United States and European Pharmacopoeia monographs', whereas G30 satisfied "Attapulgite" monograph. Cooling rates of 10% w/w spring water hydrogels were adequate for topical application as thermotherapic agents. Gel-like systems obtained with PS9 showed higher viscosities and yield values than G30 hydrogels, the type of spring water not exerting significant influence. The properties remained almost constant during a period of 2 months, ensuring quality standards. Longer periods resulted in unforeseeable changes in properties ascribed to water losses.

India aims to significantly increase the contribution of geothermal energy to its energy mix. In order to do so, a thorough investigation into the geothermal resources of India is of utmost importance. Here we report the hydrochemistry and stable isotope systematics of thermal springs located in the state of Odisha, Eastern India, to evaluate the feasibility of harnessing the geothermal reservoirs. Water chemistry and stable isotope ratios of surface-, non-thermal and thermal water were studied to access the origin and chemical evolution of the thermal waters. The waters had a pH of 5.9 to 8.6 and a suggested meteoric origin based on their delta O-18 and delta D ratios. Chemical geothermometers indicate reservoir temperatures in the range 96-128?C, caused by a high radiogenic heat production at depth coupled with the deep circulation of meteoric water through faults. Processes such as water-rock-interaction, mixing of thermal water with the shallow groundwater and mineral precipitation and dissolution were found to be responsible for the chemical evolution of the thermal waters.

In order to protect the hot springs from dewatering and loss of pressure due to large-scale quarrying and deep drilling, it is necessary to identify the sources and routes whereby the thermal water travels to its resurgences in the Avon valley. Control over deep water movements is exercised by the structure and size of the aquifers and aquicludes, modified by zones of Quaternary-Recent fracturing along which water movements have not been restricted or blocked by mineralization.											25	5	5	0	4	SPRINGER VERLAG	NEW YORK	175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010	0177-5146			ENVIRON GEOL	Environ.

The chemical compositions of these thermal waters reflect the provenance and circulation patterns -of the groundwater, which are controlled by recharge, rock type and geological structure. Exploring the provenance of these waters using multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) techniques increases our understanding of the hydrothermal circulation systems, and provides a reliable tool for assessing these resources. Hydrochemical data from thermal springs situated in the CarboniferouS Dublin Basin in east-central Ireland were explored using MSA, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), to investigate the source aquifers of the thermal groundwaters. To take into account the compositional nature of the hydrochemical data, compositional data analysis (CoDa) techniques were used to process the data prior to the MSA. The results of the MSA were examined alongside detailed time-lapse temperature measurements from several of the springs, and indicate the influence of three important hydrogeological processes on the hydrochemistry of the thermal waters: 1) salinity and increased water-rock interaction; 2) dissolution of carbonates; and 3) dissolution of sulfides, sulfates and oxides associated with mineral deposits. The use of MSA within the CoDa framework identified subtle temporal variations in the hydrochemistry of the thermal springs, which could not be identified with more traditional graphing methods, or with a standard statistical approach. The MSA was successful in distinguishing different geological settings and different annual behaviours within the group of springs. This study denionstrates the usefulness of the application of MSA within the'CoDa framework in order to better understand the underlyihg controlling processes governing the hydrochemistry of a group of thermal springs in a low-enthalpy setting.

Two important benchmarks are recognized, the human body temperature and the mean annual local air temperature. While no scheme can claim to provide an objective, unbiased classification, waters emerging with a temperature in excess of the core human body temperature of 36.7 degreesC should be defined as hot springs. The term "thermal spring" is not recommended as it cannot be defined satisfactorily for all springs. The term "warm spring" is not considered utilitarian.

These waters have been used on a large scale for medical and bathing purposes; for therapy, rehabilitation and recreation, while mineral waters from several locations are also used for drinking. The Ra-226 content of thermal and mineral waters ranged from 0.07 to 4.40 Bq l(-1). In the spas in which waters were used both for bathing and drinking purposes, Ra-226 activities in some springs were found to exceed the maximal permissible level of 1 Bg l(-1) for drinking water. On the assumption that a drinking cure contains 1 litre of mineral water daily for 1 week, the radium body burden originating from drinking this water would be on average 2.1 times higher than that originated from the consumption of 1 litre per day of tap water over 1 year.

Real Time Observation of the Thermal Bar and Spring Stratification of Lake Michigan with the GLUCOS Coastal Observatory	OCEANS 2008, VOLS 1-4	OCEANS-IEEE		English	Proceedings Paper	OCEANS 2008 Conference	SEP 15-18, 2008	Quebec City, CANADA	IEEE			GREAT-LAKES; FRONTS; WATERS	During the spring of 2008 a subset of the WATER Institute's Great Lakes Urban Coastal Observing System (GLUCOS) was deployed to demonstrate the ability of the observatory to remotely monitor, in real time, the seasonal transition from a mixed state to a stratified state in coastal Lake Michigan. A prominent feature of this transition is the spring thermal front, also known as the thermal bar, a boundary of 4 degrees C water that extends from top to bottom and separates near-shore stratified water from colder, mixed water further off-shore. Three Pioneer II buoys were deployed in a west to east line at 20m, 40m and 60m depths and at distances of 2 km, 6 km and 12 km from shore respectively. Each buoy was equipped with a string of temperature sensors spaced one meter apart from the bottom to about 3 meters below the surface. The buoys communicated with a shore station using 900 MHz radio modems. An Internet connection was established between the WATER Institute and the buoys via the shore station permitting two-way communication for real-time data retrieval and control of the buoys. The spring thermal transition was remotely observed at the 20 in buoy along with its characteristic 4 degrees C thermal bar. This paper will present the data on the spring thermal evolution of the lake as measured by the GLUCOS observatory and will describe the design of the new Pioneer II buoy that made-up the buoy array for this experiment.

The thermal springs, characterized by high total dissolved solids (TDS) contents and predominance of NaCl, ascend from aquifers at 3-4 km depth and discharge at a temperature of 65-70 degrees C. The barite-(pyrite) mineralization is found in upflow and discharge zones of the present-day thermal springs as well as at elevations up to 50 m above the current water table. Hence, this mineralization style constitutes a continuous record of the hydrothermal activity, linking the past evolution with the present state of this geothermal system. The sulphur isotope signatures of the mineralization indicate a continuous decrease of the delta S-34 of sulphate from +16.9 parts per thousand. in the oldest barite to +10.1 parts per thousand. in the present-day thermal water. The delta S-34 values of barite closely resemble various recently active thermal springs along the southern margin of the Rhenish Massif and contrast strongly with different regional ground and mineral waters. The mineralogical and isotopic signatures, combined with calculations based on uplift rates and the regional geological history, indicate a minimum activity of the thermal spring system at Wiesbaden of about 500 000 years. This timeframe is considerably larger than conservative models, which estimate the duration of thermal spring systems in continental intraplate settings to last for several 10 000 years. The calculated equilibrium sulphur isotope temperatures of coexisting barite and pyrite range between 65 and 80 degrees C, close to the discharge temperature of the springs, which would indicate apparent equilibrium precipitation. Kinetic modelling of the re-equilibration of the sulphate-sulphicle pair during water ascent shows that this process would require 220 Myr. Therefore, we conclude that pyrite is formed from precursor Fe monosulphide phases, which rapidly precipitate in the near-surface environment, preserving the isotope fractionation between dissolved sulphate and sulphide established in the deep aquifer. Equilibrium modelling of water-mineral reactions shows slight supersaturation of barite at the discharge temperature. Pyrite is already strongly supersaturated at the temperatures estimated for the aquifer (110 degrees C) and processes in the near-surface environment are most probably related to contact of the thermal water with atmospheric oxygen, resulting in formation of oxidized intermediate sulphur species and precipitation of Fe monosulphide phases, which subsequently recrystallize to pyrite.

Very dynamic thermal activity inside the crater (variations in chemistry and migration of pools and fumaroles, drastic changes in the crater lake volume and chemistry) contrasts with the stable behavior of the flank hot springs during the time of observations (1974-2005). All known groups of hot springs are located on the contact of the basement and volcanic edifice, and only on the W-SW-S slopes of the volcano at almost same elevations 600-650 m asl and less than 3 km of direct distance from the crater. Three groups of near-neutral (pH approximate to 6) springs at SW-S slopes have the total thermal water outflow rate higher than 300 I/s and are similar in composition. The fourth and farthest group on the western slope discharges acidic (pH approximate to 2)saline (10 g/kg of CI) water with a much lower outflow rate (< 10 I/s). Water-rock interaction modeling of main types of the El Chichon thermal waters using regular log Q/K graphs (saturation indices vs temperature) showed maximum equilibrium temperature slightly higher than 200 degrees C. Acidic waters are equilibrated with some clay minerals at about 120 degrees C. Three main sources of the salinity of thermal water are suggested on the basis of mixing plots and isotopic data: a magmatic source for CO2, boron, sulfur and a limited part of Cl; volcanic rock source for the major cations and trace elements: the oil-bearing evaporitic basement source (oil-field brine?) for NaCl, Br, a part of Ca and some trace elements. All flank thermal springs end up in the river Rio Magdalena that has a variable seasonal flow rates from 4 to 20 m(3)/s. Any changes in the chemistry of springs must notably change the composition of the streams draining hot springs and eventually, Rio Magdalena. A monthly geochemical monitoring of Rio Magdalena and streams draining main hot springs would be a useful tool for surveying the activity of the volcano. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four thermal springs and another twelve normal springs are hosted by local deep faults in south China, which are considered to have significant connection to deep geothermal activity. Between 4% and 6% mantle He in thermal springs reveals that significant mantle He migration in deep faults can bring a certain amount of energy, along with thermal volatiles, and contribute to thermal spring formation according to He-3/He-4. While delta C-13 reveals that dissolved inorganic carbon in thermal springs is from rock metamorphism that occurred in certain deep crust as geothermal activity, which is potentially the main energy source of the thermal springs.

The object of the present work is to study the possible energy use of two sources of thermal hot water (spring and waste water) by restructuring of the existing spa so that it is more efficient from both a technical and economic point of view. In this first part, hot water needs are calculated and consumption presented according to the operation schedule on different types of day. Comparison is then made with the contribution that the spring is capable of making and the evolution of the thermal water in the tanks is studied. In a second work, energy and economic analyses will be presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

S	Mahala, SC	Mahala, SC			Mahala, Subash Chandra	Mahala, SC		Study Area	GEOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND GENESIS OF THERMAL SPRINGS OF ODISHA, INDIA	SpringerBriefs in Earth Sciences		English	Article; Book Chapter								The thermal springs are located at eight different places in Odisha which can be approached by road from the state capital Bhubaneswar. The thermal springs ooze out from a single spout at Attri, Taptapani, Magarmuhan, Bankhol and Boden areas but oozing at several spots clustered together at Tarabalo, Deuljhori and Badaberena. The highest number of spots has been traced at Tarabalo thermal spring area. There is continuous seepage of hot water in and around the spots and the area has been waterlogged and swampy. There are luxuriant growth of screw pines around the thermal spring particularly noted at Tarabalo and Deuljhori. In most of the cases the thermal spring spots are protected by masonry structures. Encrustation of white and yellowish material is marked on the surface as well as parapet wall. Temples are constructed at certain period of times near these springs, as people find them as place of worship because of natural curiosities. Location and surface mode of manifestations are captured through photographs. The physiographic set-up and climatic condition around thermal spring regions are also noted.											2	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							13	22		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_2	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		10	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400003

NOV.; HOT-SPRINGS; SP. NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; GEOTHERMAL WATERS	Anaerobic cultivable microbial communities in thermal springs producing hydrolytic enzymes were studied. Thermal water samples from seven thermal springs located in the Andean volcanic belt, in the eastern and central mountain ranges of the Colombian Andes were used as inocula for the growth and isolation of thermophilic microorganisms using substrates such as starch, gelatin, xylan, cellulose, Tween 80, olive oil, peptone and casamino acids. These springs differed in temperature (50-70 degrees C) and pH (6.5-7.5). The predominant ion in eastern mountain range thermal springs was sulphate, whereas that in central mountain range springs was bicarbonate. A total of 40 anaerobic thermophilic bacterial strains that belonged to the genera Thermoanaerobacter, Caloramator, Anoxybacillus, Caloranaerobacter, Desulfomicrobium, Geotoga, Hydrogenophilus, Desulfacinum and Thermoanaerobacterium were isolated. To investigate the metabolic potential of these isolates, selected strains were analysed for enzymatic activities to identify strains than can produce hydrolytic enzymes. We demonstrated that these thermal springs contained diverse microbial populations of anaerobic thermophilic comprising different metabolic groups of bacteria including strains belonging to the genera Thermoanaerobacter, Caloramator, Anoxybacillus, Caloranaerobacter, Desulfomicrobium, Geotoga, Hydrogenophilus, Desulfacinum and Thermoanaerobacterium with amylases, proteases, lipases, esterases, xylanases and pectinases; therefore, the strains represent a promising source of enzymes with biotechnological potential.

Thermal waters with temperatures of 44-60A degrees C are used for central heating and balneologic purposes. Paleozoic rocks of the KirAYehir Massif are the oldest units in the study area. The basement of the Massif comprises Paleozoic metamorphic schist and marbles which partly contain white quartzite layers of a few tens of cm thickness. The metamorphic schists which are cut by granites of Paleocene age are overlain by horizontally bedded conglomerate, sandstone, claystone, and limestone of upper Paleocene-Eocene age. Among the thermal and cold waters collected from the areas of Terme and Karakurt, those from thermal waters are enriched with Ca-HCO3 and cold waters are of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type waters. The pH values of samples are 6.31-7.04 for the thermal well waters, 6.41 for thermal spring, 7.25 and 7.29 for the cold waters, and 7.52 for the Hirla lake water. EC values are 917-2,295 mu S/cm for the thermal well waters, 2,078 mu S/cm for thermal spring, and 471 and 820 mu S/cm for the cold springs. The lowest TDS content is from water of T10 thermal well in the Terme area (740.6 mg/l). The hot and cold waters of Terme show very similar ion contents while the Karakurt hot waters at western most parts are characterized by distinct chemical compositions. There is ion exchange in thermal waters from the T5 (5), T6 (6), T12 (7), and T1 (8) wells in the Terme area. The thermal waters show low concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, Al, As, Pb, Zn and Cu. Waters in the study area are of meteoric origin, and rainwater percolated downwards through faults and fractures, and are heated by the geothermal gradient, later rising to the surface along permeable zones. delta C-13(VPDB) values measured on dissolved inorganic carbon in samples range from -1.65 to +5.61aEuro degrees for thermal waters and from -11.81 to -10.15aEuro degrees for cold waters. Carbon in thermal waters is derived from marine carbonates or CO2 of metamorphic origin while carbon in cold waters originates from freshwater carbonates.

Fifteen samples were collected from cold and hot springs. The data obtained from sampling period indicate a high level of mineralization (a TDS of up to 6657mg/L) of thermal waters with three dominant water types (Ca-SO4, Ca-HCO3, Na-Cl). The chemical geothermometers applied to thermal waters show that the study area is influenced in part through dilution by the infiltration of surface waters. The isotopic contents of hot springs vary from -8.26 to -6.83 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and from -55.23 parts per thousand to -42.01 parts per thousand for 2H. These results reveal a meteoric origin of thermal waters infiltrated at major faults and heated by deep flow before being discharged to the surface by fractures.

Indeed, surface and subsurface geological investigations reveal that the lower Cretaceous composed by carbonated and sandy deposits could constitute a reservoir of thermal waters in the study area. The geochemical, isotopical, geothermometrical studies are capital to determine the water type, to relate thermal waters to their origins and to estimate their temperatures at depth. These studies constitute an adequate tool for the delimitation of the hydrogeothermic basins. The integrated processing of all the existing data confirms well that the thermal spring of Southern Gabes has a deep origin. Thermal waters up come and reappeared at surface by a vertical drainance and favoured by the tectonic dysharmonies. The hydrogeothermic approach permitted us to relate thermal spring of Hammam Zarat to the reservoir of Lower Cretaceous carbonated and sandy deposits: Using the area's geothermic gradient (2.81 degrees C/100m) and the temperatures at depth, the origin reservoir was localised at 1950 m depth.

Themal springs were characterized by flame photometery, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy, ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray flourescent spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy and titrations (argentometric, acidemetic & complexometric). They are classified on the basis of pH, temperature and mineral contents. The common mineral contents in these springs include 0.67-621.99 mg/L sodium, 0.67-189 mg/L potassium, 2.06-84 mg/L calcium, 0.00-56 mg/L magnesium, 0.12-12 mg/L fluorides, 0.00-982.62 mg/L chlorides, 0.15-442 mg/L sulphates and 4.3-494 mg/L bicarbonates. Their temperatures were found in the range of 26.0-90.50 degrees C with the pH 2.0-9.7 and TDS value of 104.74-2188 mg/L. The mineral concentration in most thermal springs is highly ideal for the treatment of numerous diseases including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, rosacea, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic bronchitis/asthma, obesity, wounds healing and cardiovascular diseases. For curative purposes, the body is soaked in thermal waters or water may be used in the form of drinking/inhaling.

The data on the concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes and rare-earth elements, as well as on the volume activity of radon, in the treated underground and surface waters are obtained for the first time. Based on the data of automated monitoring of the physical parameters, the hydrogeological characteristics of the thermal waters are determined and the balneal properties are evaluated. The results obtained show the atmospheric origin of the nitric thermal waters of the Ulsk spring; however, the indicative chemical elements occurring in the considered waters represent the effects of deep-seated high-temperature processes as well. It is found that the waters warmed to 31 degrees C within fractured Paleocene granites do not show significant variations of temperature, and the chemical composition varies exclusively under the interaction with the water-enclosing rocks. The profiles of the distribution of rare-earth elements (REEs) in the thermal waters represent the REE distribution in the water-enclosing granitoids and point to the limitation of the thermal water circulation with the area of the occurrence of the Paleocene granites of the Bekchi-Ul Massif. The temperature of the deep-seated reservoir measured by geothermometers was 80 degrees C or below, which may indicate a depth of water circulation of 1-2 km or less.	[Chelnokov, G. A.; Bragin, I.

The Obuki hot spring water discharges after mixing of magmatic gas with meteoric water and underground vapor-liquid separation. SO42- and H2S was formed by the disproportionation reaction of SO2 at around 220 degrees C. Tritium concentration indicated that the subsurface residence time of the Obuki hot spring water is 13-25 years. In the downstream of the Obuki hot spring, there are many hyper-acidic hot springs that are diluted by meteoric water and flow as a river (Yukawa). (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is an alpha-emitting noble gas and it can be found in various concentrations in soil, air and in different kinds of water. In this study, we present the results of radon concentration measurements in thermal waters taken from the sources in the region of Konya located in the central part of Turkey. The radon activity concentrations in 10 thermal water samples were measured by using the AlphaGUARD PQ 2000PRO radon gas analyser in spring and summer of the year 2012. We found that radon activity concentrations range from 0.60 +/- 0.11 to 70.34 +/- 3.55kBqm(-3) and from 0.67 +/- 0.03 to 36.53 +/- 4.68kBqm(-3) in spring and summer, respectively. We also calculated effective doses per treatment in the spas for the spring and summer seasons. It was found that the minimum and maximum effective doses per treatment are in the range of 0.09-10.13 nSv in spring and in the range of 0.1-5.26 nSv in summer.

Actively discharging thermal springs and mineralization are present in a structural zone that extends over at least 60 km along strike, with two of the main centers of hydrothermal activity being Wiesbaden and Bad Nauheim. This setting provides the rare opportunity to link the chemistry and isotopic signatures of modern thermal waters directly with fossil mineralization dating back to at least 500-800 ka. The fossil thermal spring mineralization can be classified into two major types: barite-(pyrite) fracture filling associated with laterally-extensive silicification; and barite, goethite and silica impregnation mineralization in Tertiary sediments. Additionally, carbonatic sinters occur around active springs. Strontium isotope and trace element data suggest that mixing of a hot (>100 degrees C), deep-sourced thermal water with cooler groundwater from shallow aquifers is responsible for present-day thermal spring discharge and fossil mineralization. The correlation between both Sr and S isotope ratios and the elevation of the barite mineralization relative to the present-day water table in Wiesbaden is explained by mixing of deep-sourced thermal water having high Sr-87/Sr-86 and low delta S-34 with shallow groundwater of lower Sr-87/Sr-86 and higher delta S-34. The Sr isotope data demonstrate that the hot thermal waters originate from an aquifer in the Variscan crystalline basement at depths of 3-5 km. The S isotope data show that impregnation-type mineralization is strongly influenced by mixing with SO4 that has high delta S-34 values. The fracture style mineralization formed by cooling of the thermal waters, whereas impregnation-type mineralization precipitated by mixing with SO4-rich groundwater percolating through the sediments.

The chemical characteristics of most of the spring waters suggest that the water in their feeding aquifers is largely derived from seawater that enters the hydrological circuits and mixes with local neutral low-salinity bicarbonate waters. There are however discrepancies between the simple theoretical mixing line between local meteoric waters and seawater, and the actual mixing line. This mixing is accompanied by partial Mg and SO4 precipitation to secondary minerals and by the addition of K, Ca, HCO3, B, NH4, and SiO2 to the solutions as a result of water-rock interaction processes. At Miles and Nisyros, where active hydrothermal systems are present at shallow depth, the silica content of the thermal springs is much higher than that of springs on the other islands and mainland Greece. This suggests higher thermal gradients at depth there, and the ascent of geothermal fluids to the surface along fractures prevalently located in the fumarolic fields within the latest eruptive centers and calderas. The fact that the springs are anomalously enriched in silica only at Miles and Nisyros suggests indirectly that, apart from Santorini island, where steam vents are present at the surface, the fluids from the active high-enthalpy geothermal systems do not rise to the surface anywhere else along the HVA. If present, they are well confined under thick and impermeable covers. (C) 1997 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Most of the springs are located in the Valles-Penedes graben, where they correspond to local topography-driven flow systems. The Caldetes thermal water spring cannot be explained easily in these terms. From the chemical and isotopic composition of these waters, a recharge area at an elevation of at least 600 m is inferred, most likely in the Montseny massif some 20 km NW of Caldetes. We propose a deep flow system with infiltration of meteoric fluids from the Montseny massif. Fluids then pass through tertiary units of the Valles-Penedes graben and infiltrate faults and fracture zones that are connected to the bounding faults of the Barcelona halfgraben. Fluids finally ascend along these faults and are discharged as thermal waters at Caldetes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It aims at understanding how these thermal springs operated a determined and specific type of education in the bodies of their visito rs, with their many indications, prescriptions and possibilities. The sources include travel guides, medical journals and conference proceedings addressing the subject of thermal springs.

Controls on the genesis of a high-fluoride thermal spring: Innot Hot Springs, north Queensland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						fluoride; fluorite; granite; hot springs; Innot Hot Springs; Queensland	MOLAL THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; F-CL-OH; MINERALS; EMUFORD; DISTRICT; GRANITES; SYSTEM; ROCKS	This study reports on the source, evolution, reactions and environmental impacts of F-rich thermal water at Innot Hot Springs, north Queensland. Thermal water of the Innot Hot Springs has a surface temperature of 71 degrees C, alkaline pH (8.1), low dissolved oxygen (0.61 mg/L) and low total dissolved solids (652 mg/L). The main chemical composition is Na - Cl, with F concentrations (16 mg/L) being comparatively high. Concentrations of alkali and alkali-earth metals (Cs, Li, Rb, Sr) are elevated, while those of other trace elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, U, Zn) are significantly less. Hydrochemical and stable isotope data of hot spring water show that the fluid is meteoric in origin and has undergone significant water - granite interaction. Common geothermometers suggest temperatures of water - rock interaction at depth in the 119 - 158 degrees C range (corresponding to a depth of < 3.9 - 5.2 km). Solubility modelling of the thermal fluid demonstrates that the evolution of F concentrations in spring waters at the discharge site can be accounted for by fluid - rock interaction of a H2O - NaCl solution with fluorite - calcite-bearing granite assemblages between 150 and 200 degrees C and subsequent granite-buffered cooling. Modelling also indicates that the F concentration in the hydrothermal system is largely controlled by interactions with fluorite, with less evidence for the significant involvement of F-topaz. Speciation calculations demonstrate that F speciation in the fluid is dominated by F- (99.4%), followed by minor CaF+ (0.5%) and NaF(aq) (0.1%), and traces of other F complexes. Thus, the F- rich Innot Hot Springs result from meteoric water circulating through fluorite-bearing granitic rocks and are the surface expression of a low-temperature, non-volcanic geothermal system. Discharge of the hot spring water occurs into an ephemeral stream located in a seasonally wet - dry tropical climate. As a result, the F content of local surface waters is distinctly elevated (max. 18 mg/L) during the dry season, making them unsuitable for stock water supplies.

TDS of the hot water ranges from 459 to 475 mg/L and pH varies between 8.6 and 9.13. The water is of Na-SO4 type. Isotopic analyses indicate that the hot spring is meteoric in origin and receives recharge from precipitation in the northern and northwestern granite mountain with elevation of about 1,600-1,800 m. The depth of circulation of the thermal groundwater is estimated to be 2,240 m below the spring's threshold and the temperature of the geothermal reservoir, 76 degrees C. The residence time of the thermal groundwater is estimated to be about 52 years. A flowing well near the spring has chemical compositions and formation conditions similar to the spring. The discharge of the flowing well is approximately eighteen times larger than that of the spring and the residence time of the former (about 15.4 years) is about three times smaller than that of the latter. Although the well and spring are close to each other, the well's larger flow rates, indicated residence time and high hydraulic head suggest that the well taps a separate, but genetically similar flow system.

The principal recharge zone is suggested to be above 2000 m elevation on Mount Rundle, circulation depths are estimated to be 3.2 +/- 0.6 km, and discharge is focused along the Sulphur Mountain Thrust. Springs show constant temperature and total dissolved solids load throughout the winter, whereas both drop in association with spring snowmelt. The degree and timing of temperature drops are a function of elevation, with the highest springs showing the earliest and most significant temperature drop. The highest elevation springs also show the greatest seasonal variability in water chemistry. Unusual seasonal flow stoppages of these springs are related to extreme low precipitation years. The biogeochemistry of the thermal springs and population fluctuations of the endemic and endangered Banff springs snail (Physella johnsoni) are strongly related to seasonal variability in flow rates. Changes in redox conditions associated with an influx of shallow groundwater during spring snowmelt negatively impact the microbial community that forms a principal food supply for the snail.

The standard deviation of the recorded water temperature was only 0.15 degrees C, while the difference between the maximum and minimum values was 0.75 degrees C. The water temperature of the thermal stream, measured at 1 m distance from the thermal springs (which are grouped together in a common constructed exurgence area) does not exhibit the diurnal oscillation of the day-night cycle recorded in the air temperature. The average air temperature recorded in Valea Bailor, near the water monitoring point, from November 2015 to January 2016 was 1.47 degrees C. The standard deviation of the air temperature was 4.16 degrees C, while the difference between the maximum (positive number) and minimum (negative number) values was 28 degrees C. Longer air and water temperature time series could be used to decide if there is any correlation between the local climate and the studied thermal springs.

Insights into the origin of the thermal springs of Bath and Bristol, England, from geophysical data	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY			English	Article							HOT-SPRINGS; SPA	The thermal springs of Bath, England, produce 1.25 Ml day(-1) of water at 46.5 degrees C. The spring at Hotwells, Bristol, England, 15 km to the west, is estimated to produce between 0.17 and 0.39 Ml day(-1) of water at a temperature between 22.8 and 24.4 degrees C. Published research suggests that the waters originate in the Mendip Hills, SW of Bath and Bristol, and are heated by geothermal energy within the Carboniferous Limestone basin ('The Mendips Model'). The exact paths of the waters to the springs have not been established. We interpreted seismic reflection data for the urban district of Bath and for the Radstock Basin to the south of Bath. By combining the geophysical interpretations with published geological data we have established a potential route through the Carboniferous Limestone reaching sufficient depths for the waters to attain the required temperatures. We imaged a steeply dipping, fractured region of Carboniferous Limestone coincident with the valley of the River Avon and propose that this is the feature by which the thermal waters can rise rapidly to the surface, providing an explanation for the existence of these unique springs. We have incorporated these new aspects of the Mendip Model into the 'Mendip-Avon Fracture Zone Model'.	[McCann, C.; McCann, D.

Although the water of thermal structures provides beneficial effects on human health, the air is characterized by the presence of potentially toxic compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Exposure to sulphurous compounds may have detrimental effects on human health, with asthma being the most common. In this study, air concentrations of H2S and SO2 in the thermal springs of Contursi Terme (Salerno, Italy) were monitored for 4 months (using both active and passive sampling), along with the chemical and microclimatic characterization of thermal water, to assess workers' exposure to these pollutants. An in-depth characterization of indoor air at the springs is paramount to establish emission control limits for occupational exposure and to take protective measures. The air concentration of SO2 varied from 0.11 +/- 0.02 to 0.91 +/- 0.02 mg/m(3), following a seasonal pattern (higher values in winter and lower in spring). Conversely, indoor H2S concentrations did not vary significantly with time, but outdoor levels (from 0.40 +/- 0.03 to 1.90 +/- 0.03 mg/m(3)) were always higher than indoor ones (from 0.11 +/- 0.03 to 0.56 +/- 0.03 mg/m(3)). Not negligible air concentrations of these pollutants were detected in this thermal spring workplace, so further investigations are needed to ensure workers' safety.

In literature, the microbial diversity of hot spring waters has been the focus of extensive research, while there is a paucity of studies on thermal water distribution network of spa centres and, as yet, no studies have been carried out on the bacterial population of thermal muds. In this context, the aim of our study is to characterize the microbial community of sulphurous-bromine-iodine thermal water and mud within an Italian spa complex using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This is the first report of microbiome characterization along a water supply network from the spring to points of use within a spa. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis, our data highlight the presence of a typical microbial community, mainly composed of sulphur-cycling bacteria belonging to Desulfomonile, Thermodesulfovibrio, Geothermobacterium, Thermus, Thiofaba and Syntrophomonas genera. In addition, the characterization and evolution of the bacterial community in thermal muds during the maturation process is investigated for the first time. Interestingly, the microbiome of mature mud resulted dominated by bacteria capable of lipid biosynthesis, suggesting that these bacteria may play a role in the anti-rheumatic properties of thermal mud.

Only 30% of the springs with temperatures up to 22.5 & x202f;degrees C are utilized. Future exploration and exploitation will require quantifying their resource potential and development of a conceptual hydrogeological model. A detailed and comprehensible explanation of the thermal anomaly has not yet been formulated. Methods including a combination of natural tracers, geochemical indicators and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D, delta S-34) have been used for identifying their genesis and their associated aquifers. Hydrogeological and hydrochemical investigations have been conducted from 2011-2018, evaluating groundwater from 14 surrounding springs and two tunnels. This study shows that the thermal water originates mainly from rock glaciers and meteoric waters from the Grierkar, entering swallow holes of the Hochstegen formation at the Grieralm. The thermal anomaly is caused by a groundwater component (20-40%) from footwall gneisses, probably connected to the marble aquifer by the Tux shear zones.

J	Senturk, N; Mutlu, H				Senturk, Nizamettin; Mutlu, Halim			A Geochemical Approach to the Origin of Geothermal and Mineral Waters Southwest of Uludag Mountain (Bursa)	TURKIYE JEOLOJI BULTENI-GEOLOGICAL BULLETIN OF TURKEY			Turkish	Article						Bursa; Geothermal spring; hydrogeochemistry; isotope; mineral water; Uludag	THERMAL WATERS; NOBLE-GASES; EVOLUTION; TURKEY; CONSTRAINTS; ISOTOPES; PLATE; ZONE	In this study, hydrogeochemical characteristics and the origin of geothermal springs and mineral waters southwest of Uludag (Bursa) Mountain were investigated. Temperatures of thermal waters are 37-64.5 degrees C and those of mineral waters range from 15.6 to 22.5 degrees C. Total dissolved solid (TDS) content of waters is in the range of 451 to 2026 mg/l. The pH of mineral waters (6.2 - 6.7) is much more acidic than thermal waters (7.1 - 7.3). Thermal waters are represented by Na-Ca-HCO3 facies type, while mineral waters are Mg-Na-Ca-HCO3 type. Tritium measured in the Bursa mineral waters is 0.34 to 5.96 TU. Thermal waters (0.34 to 1.95 TU) have lower tritium content than mineral waters (1.57 to 5.46 T). These results indicate that most of studied fluids are regarded as modern waters. delta O-18 of samples is -11.08 to -7.97 parts per thousand (VSMOW) and delta D values are in the range of -73.81 to -57.64 parts per thousand (VSMOW). Stable isotope compositions of Bursa mineral water are located between Global and Mediterranean Water Lines, indicating meteoric origin. delta C-13 values measured in dissolved inorganic carbon (HCO3) are between -15.3 and +10.12 parts per thousand (VPDB). Carbon isotope compositions of thermal waters are about 15 parts per thousand lower than those of mineral waters, implying that carbon in thermal springs is derived from an organic source. Carbon in mineral waters originates from marine limestones. Using the deuterium-altitude relationship, the recharge zone for Bursa mineral waters was at 1180-2300 m.

J	Bouri, S; Makni, J; Ben Dhia, H				Bouri, Salem; Makni, Jalila; Ben Dhia, Hamed			A synthetic approach integrating surface and subsurface data for prospecting deep aquifers: the Southeast Tunisia	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						geothermal gradient; thermal spring; aquifer; temperature; hydrogeology; Southeast Tunisia	GEOTHERMAL GRADIENT; EQUILIBRIA; EVOLUTION	The Southeast Tunisia has remarkable thermal springs that have been used for bathing since many years. Currently, studies are being carried out to investigate the possible use of the hot water for heating buildings and for greenhouses. Springs with discharge temperatures between 26.8 and 58 degrees C exist in the area. The flow rates range between 7 and 66 l/s with total dissolved solids (TDS) varying between 2,020 and 4,030 mg/l. Both geological-hydrogeological setting and the similarity in chemical characteristics between the Zarat spring and nearby water wells suggest that the hot water from this spring may be related to the Senonian aquifer. However, the hydrogeothermal approach shows that the depth of the reservoir that supplies the Zarat spring is greater than that of the Senonian aquifer. In fact, geothermometry approach indicates that fluids emerging from the Lower Cretaceous sandstones reach temperatures of approximately 78 degrees C at depth, while the fluid temperature from the nearby water wells is 32 degrees C. Through the integration of various types of data we found that the thermal water of Southeast Tunisia is of meteoric origin. This water infiltrates deeply into the Lower Cretaceous sandstones and reaches a high temperature before rising upwards to supply the hot springs and well discharge zones. It appears that the upward movement of hot water from the deep aquifers to shallow ones is probably due to the abundant fractures in the area.

Research programmes have considered the surface evidence (thermal springs) and underground thermal information from deep and shallow wells. The main chemical characteristics of the sampled thermal springs and the results of the application of geothermometers as result from these studies are presented. Of the 238 inventoried thermal springs, 169 have been selected, on the basis of complete water analyses and acceptable ionic balances. Measured temperatures range from 22.5 to 98 degrees C, thermal indexes from 0.5 to 78 degrees C and salinities from 0.13 to 52.5 g/L. Most studied springs are sodium-chloride type waters. These basic data allow identification of the main thermal anomalies in the Maghrebian zone, which are located in regions of the Libyan-Tunisian, Algerian-Moroccan and Algerian-Tunisian frontiers, of northern Tunisia, the Eastern Rif and the northern part of the Saharan Atlas. Several chemical geothermometers have been applied to selected springs: Na-K, Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, Na/Li, Mg/Li, K-2/Mg, quartz, chalcedony (Fournier) and chalcedony (Arnorsson). The Na-K, Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, Na/Li and Mg/Li geothermometers seem to give unreliable results, while K-2/Mg and silica temperatures are apparently reasonable. However, dissolved silica seems to be governed by quartz solubility for some thermal springs and by chalcedony solubility for others. The results are tentatively compared with known geothermal gradients and geological features. (C) 1998 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The temperature of the sources ranged from 21 degrees C to 59.5 degrees C. Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 7-10, was isolated from two out of 60 sources on the Island of Ischia and Legionella dumoffii from one mainland source. The temperatures of these sources were 35.2 degrees C, 48.2 degrees C, and 52.O degrees C respectively. Twelve sources were positive for P. aeruginosa and 6 for Escherichia coli. Our results found that Legionella spp. were present in only three thermal springs, indicating that in the hydrothermal area of the Campania region the presence of this microbial species is very scarce.

Thermal springs in this region discharge water that ranges from Na-K-Cl, silica-depositing type to Ca-Na-HCO3-SO4, travertine-depositing type. Although only a few relatively shallow wells have been drilled in the corridor, the region is of special interest because of the environmental issues associated with potential geothermal development adjacent to Yellowstone National Park. The U.S. Geological Survey conducted an intensive hydrogeologic study of this region during 1988-1990 and continued to collect hydrologic and geophysical data until 1994. The results of these investigations document the rates of discharge of thermal water and heat within the corridor, evidence for a magmatic heat source beneath the Mammoth Hot Springs area, and evidence for separate geothermal systems associated with Mammoth Hot Springs and with thermal waters discharging in the KGRA in the vicinity of La Duke Hot Springs, These investigations also indicate that limited development of the 70 degrees C geothermal resource in the La Duke area would not affect thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park.

The first confirmed case of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in Taiwan was reported in November 2011, in which the patient visited a thermal spring recreational area 1 week prior to hospitalisation. Water sampling was performed to verify the presence of Naegleria at the facility. According to our results, 32% and 20% of recreational water samples were contaminated with Naegleria spp. and Acanthamoeba spp., respectively. The genotypes of Naegleria identified at the hot spring included N. fowleri, Naegleria australiensis and Naegleria lovaniensis. Using PCR, it was determined that the strain of N. fowleri in one sample possessed the same genotype 2 as the clinical isolate. Thus, the thermal spring was suggested to be the likely source of infection. This is the first known instance of simultaneously isolating N. fowleri from both a patient as well as from a hot spring in Taiwan. Following this initial study, the pools at the thermal spring recreational area were drained, scrubbed and disinfected, and a follow-up study was performed 1 month later. Naegleria fowleri was not detected in follow-up testing; however, other Naegleria spp. were identified. We postulate that the biofilm in the waterlines may have provided a reservoir for free-living amoebae. The presence/absence of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria spp. did not differ significantly with any measured parameters related to water quality; however, a high percentage of the thermal water pool samples were contaminated with Naegleria or Acanthamoeba. Thus, amoebic contamination may present a serious threat to the health of humans who engage in leisure activities at thermal springs. (C) 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Thus, these springs may host phylogenetically novel microorganisms with potential use in biotechnology. With this hypothesis in mind, we examined the microbial composition of four thermal springs of the world-renowned spa town of Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), Czechia, which differ in their temperature and chemical composition. Results Microbial profiling using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed the presence of phylogenetically novel taxa at various taxonomic levels, spanning from genera to phyla. Many sequences belonged to novel classes within the phyla Hydrothermae, Altiarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia, and TA06. Cultivation-based methods employing oligotrophic media resulted in the isolation of 44 unique bacterial isolates. These include strains that withstand concentrations of up to 12% NaClw/v in cultivation media or survive a temperature of 100 degrees C, as well as hitherto uncultured bacterial species belonging to the genera Thermomonas, Paenibacillus, and Cellulomonas. These isolates harbored stress response genes that allow them to thrive in the extreme environment of thermal springs. Conclusions Our study is the first to analyze the overall microbial community composition of the renowned Karlovy Vary thermal springs. We provide insight into yet another level of uniqueness of these springs. In addition to their unique health benefits and cultural significance, we demonstrate that these springs harbor phylogenetically distinct microorganisms with unusual life strategies. Our findings open up avenues for future research with the promise of a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential of these microorganisms.

Understanding the evolution of thermal fluids along the western continental margin of India using geochemical and boron isotope signatures	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Boron isotope; Hydrogeochemistry; West coast; Water-rock interaction; Rare earth elements	WATER-ROCK INTERACTION; DECCAN TRAPS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; NEW-ZEALAND; FLOOD BASALTS; TOURMALINE; GROUNDWATER; ICELAND; KALADGI; CONTAMINATION	Thermal springs lined up for about 350 km along the Western coast of Maharashtra, India, have been studied for major, minor, trace and rare earth elements, along with the boron isotope ratios for selected samples, to understand their evolution pattern. These alkaline springs have discharge temperatures varying from 40 to 72 degrees C. Based on the major ion composition, it is established that most of the thermal springs are of Na(Ca)-Cl or Ca(Na)Cl type, with a few of Na-Cl(SO4) type. Only one thermal spring at Rajapur is Na-HCO3 type behavior. Trace elements concentration vary significantly e.g., Li (19-386 ppb), B (104-1362 ppb), Sr (16-13560 ppb), Rb (13-220 ppb), Cs (0.75-44 ppb) and Ba (3-2077 ppb). Chondrite-normalized REE patterns indicate a pronounced 'Eu' anomaly probably due to the involvement of plagioclase, but the effect of temperature reaching more than 250 degrees C cannot be ruled out in case of some springs. First-time study of SHB isotope (range between 2.5 parts per thousand to 27.0 parts per thousand) of the West Coast thermal fluid suggests role of leaking marine sediments in their evolution. Water-rock interaction experiments with granite, basalt and diluted seawater at elevated temperatures and pressures have given an insight into the evolution of the thermal springs. Based on all the findings, a conceptual model has been prepared, which gives an overview of the evolution of the thermal springs.

J	MINISSALE, A				MINISSALE, A			THERMAL SPRINGS IN ITALY - THEIR RELATION TO RECENT TECTONICS	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article								The large scale circulation of thermal waters in Italy is reviewed from both a chemical and an isotopic point of view. Two main areas are recognized: one in the Alpine region and the other in the central-southern Apennine region. The Alps are an area of very high hydraulic heads and low thermal gradients, where hot, deep-seated waters of meteoric origin rapidly reach the surface along active boundary fault systems. The Apennines, in contrast, are characterized by lower hydraulic heads and higher thermal gradients. All thermal springs in Italy (including those in active volcanic areas) originate essentially from meteoric waters, and most follow long pathways in Mesozoic carbonate-anhydritic aquifers before emerging, as indicated by relations among present hydrothermal activity in central-southern Italy, deep crustal structures and P(CO2) content in thermal waters.

Response of a hydrothermal system to escalating phreatic unrest: the case of Turrialba and Irazu in Costa Rica (2007-2012)	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE			English	Article						Irazu and Turrialba volcanoes; Phreatic eruptions; Thermal springs; Fluid geochemistry; Crater lake disappearance; Water budget analysis; Hazard assessment	EL CHICHON VOLCANO; CRATER-LAKE; CASITA-VOLCANO; POAS VOLCANO; THERMAL SPRINGS; TRACE-ELEMENT; TELAGA BODAS; KAWAH IJEN; EAST JAVA; GEOCHEMISTRY	This study presents the first hydrogeochemical model of the hydrothermal systems of Turrialba and Irazu volcanoes in central Costa Rica, manifested as thermal springs, summit crater lakes, and fumarolic degassing at both volcanoes. Our period of observations (2007-2012) coincides with the pre- and early syn-phreatic eruption stages of Turrialba volcano that resumed volcanic unrest since 2004, after almost 140 years of quiescence. Peculiarly, the generally stable Irazu crater lake dropped its level during this reawakening of Turrialba. The isotopic composition of discharged fluids reveals the Caribbean meteoric origin; a contribution of "andesitic water" for Turrialba fumaroles up to similar to 50% is suggested. Four groups of thermal springs drain the northern flanks of Turrialba and Irazu volcanoes into two main rivers. Rio Sucio (i.e. "dirty river") is a major rock remover on the North flank of Irazu, mainly fed by the San Cayetano spring group. Instead, one group of thermal springs discharges towards the south of Irazu. All thermal spring waters are of SO4-type (i.e. steam heated waters), although none of the springs has a common hydrothermal end-member. A water mass budget for thermal springs results in an estimated total output flux of 187 +/- 37 L/s, with 100 +/- 20 L/s accounted for by the San Cayetano springs. Thermal energy release is estimated at 110 +/- 22 MW (83.9 +/- 16.8 MW by San Cayetano), whereas the total rock mass removal rate by chemical leaching is similar to 3,000 m(3)/y (similar to 2,400 m(3)/y by San Cayetano-Rio Sucio). Despite Irazu being the currently less active volcano, it is a highly efficient rock remover, which, on the long term can have effects on the stability of the volcanic edifice with potentially hazardous consequences (e.g. flank collapse, phreatic eruptions). Moreover, the vapor output flux from the Turrialba fumaroles after the onset of phreatic eruptions on 5 January 2010 showed an increase of at least similar to 260 L/s above pre-eruptive background fumarolic vapor fluxes. This extra vapor loss implies that the drying of the summit hydrothermal system of Turrialba could tap deeper than previously thought, and could explain the coincidental disappearance of Irazu's crater lake in April 2010.

Indicator parameters of different water types were determined to significantly vary within Ulyunkhan depression. Narrow ranges were determined for the variations in the composition of the hot springs and wide ones were found in the composition of the warm and cold springs. Statistical distributions of the measured parameters of the swamp waters were shifted toward higher values compared to those of the discharged thermal waters. The following three features of the spatial distribution of water composition indicators have been identified: (1) a spotty character, (2) a trend in the water composition in the direction of transit according to the general slope of the terrain, and (3) a trend of increasing salt content in the waters near the outer shoreline of the swamp massif and around islands within it.

However, permanent and pristine spring fens in the Western Carpathians show between-site variation in thermal stability with significant effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages. In this study, we investigated the impact of the thermal stability on microcrustaceans (Harpacticoida, Ostracoda). We disentangled various parameters of thermal stability, such as mean summer and winter temperatures, annual amplitude, and daily fluctuations, and related these parameters to mesoclimate, vegetation cover, and water table. We found that the relative abundance of cold-stenothermal species decreased significantly with increasing mean water temperature in summer, which had a significant effect on species composition. Surprisingly, ostracods were completely indifferent to thermal stability despite including cold stenotherms and crenobionts, suggesting that these species might have broader thermal tolerance. By contrast, harpacticoids significantly responded to both summer and winter mean temperatures, showing upper and lower limits of thermal tolerance. While vegetation cover significantly suppressed daily fluctuations in summer, no effect of daily fluctuations on microcrustaceans was found. The effect of water table was also significant but independent of thermal stability. We assume that the less thermally stable sites will not support the occurrence of cold-stenothermic harpacticoids as air temperature rises. However, an increase in winter temperatures may result in higher overall abundance of harpacticoids. We discuss how spring fens are probably most threatened by the combination of drought and increasing temperature.

They are used for curative action and healing properties linked to their physical and chemical characteristics. In order to best use the opportunities provided by globalization, Algerian authorities try to modernize its social and economic policies investing mainly in geothermal resources recognizing that the hot springs have rich potential to develop ecotourism. Nevertheless, the use of thermal waters requires nowadays a prior characterization to study their quality. The mineral bacteriology assessment Type 0, Type 1, and Type 2 are used to assess the microbiological quality. It consists of the enumeration of total aerobic flora (37 degrees C, Coliforms and Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, sulphite-reducing bacteria spores, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella and pathogenic staphylococci using standard microbiological techniques and culture method. The sixteen thermal springs mainly from the eastern part of Algeria, whose water temperature ranges between 39 and 93 degrees C, were also subjected to hydrochemical and gamma spectrometric methods. The obtained results showed the average number of total aerobic flora ranging from 0 to 4 x 10(4) CFU/mL and the presence of Staphylococcus aureus species. Four springs revealed the presence of Legionella. Two springs among the four also exhibited a significant contamination by enterococci. The conductivity ranged from 296 to 48,100 mu S/cm. The thermal waters are rich in minerals representing the evaporite deposits leaching with high temperatures and significant mineralization in both major and minor elements. Measured activities of K-40 ranged from 360 to 6,330 mBq/L. For the U-238 series, Ra-226 activity concentrations varied from 8 to 6,110 mBq/L. Activity concentrations determined for revealed that only one thermal spring contained this radionuclide with concentration of 95 mBq/L.

J	Zaher, MA; Ehara, S; El-Qady, G				Zaher, Mohamed Abdel; Ehara, Sachio; El-Qady, Gad			Conceptual model and numerical simulation of the hydrothermal system in Hammam Faraun hot spring, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Hot springs; Hammam Faraun; Conceptual model; Numerical model; Red Sea; Gulf of Suez	WATERS	The tectonic position of Egypt in the northeastern corner of the African continent suggests that it may possess significant geothermal resources, especially along its eastern margin. The most of the thermal springs in Egypt are located along the shores of Gulf of Suez and Red Sea. These springs are probably tectonic or nonvolcanic origin associated with the opening of the Red Sea-Gulf of Suez rifts, where the eastern shore of the Gulf of Suez is characterized by superficial thermal manifestations including a cluster of hot springs with varied temperatures. Hammam Faraun area consists of the hottest spring in Egypt where the water temperature is 70A degrees C. Conceptual as well as numerical models were made on the Hammam Faraun hot spring based on geological, geochemical, and geophysical data. The models show that the heat source of the hot spring is probably derived from high heat flow and deep water circulation controlled by faults associated with the opening of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez rifts.

J	Taran, YA; Peiffer, L				Taran, Yuri A.; Peiffer, Loic			Hydrology, hydrochemistry and geothermal potential of El Chichon volcano-hydrothermal system, Mexico	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Geothermal; Chloride inventory; Flow measurements; Hot springs; Heat and mass output; Hydrothermal systems; El Chichon; Mexico	CRATER LAKE; THERMAL SPRINGS; 1982 ERUPTIONS; CHIAPAS; GEOCHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; GASES; EQUILIBRIA; DISCHARGE; MAGMAS	Fluid and heat discharge rates of thermal springs of El Chichon volcano were measured using the chloride inventory method. Four of the five known groups of hot springs discharge near-neutral Na-Ca-Cl-SO4 waters with a similar composition (Cl similar to 1500-2000 mg kg(-1) and Cl/SO4 similar to 3) and temperatures in the 50-74 degrees C range. The other group discharges acidic (pH 2.2-2.7) Na-Cl water of high salinity (>15 g/L). All five groups are located on the volcano slopes, 2-3 kin in a straight line from the bottom of the volcano crater. They are in the upper parts of canyons where thermal waters mix with surface meteoric waters and form thermal streams. All these streams flow into the Rio Magdalena, which is the only drainage of all thermal waters coming from the volcano. The total Cl and SO4 discharges measured in the Rio Magdalena downstream from its junction with all the thermal streams are very close to the sum of the transported Cl and S04 by each of these streams, indicating that the infiltration through. the river bed is low. The net discharge rate of hydrothermal Cl measured for all thermal springs is about 468 g s(-1). which corresponds to 234 kg s(-1) of hot water with Cl = 2000 mg kg(-1). Together with earlier calculations of the hydrothermal steam output from the volcano crater, the total natural heat output from El Chichon is estimated to be about 160 MWt. Such a high and concentrated discharge of thermal waters from a hydrothermal system is not common and may indicate the high geothermal potential of the system. For the deep water temperatures in the 200-250 degrees C range (based on geothermometry), and a mass flow rate of 234 kg s(-1), the total heat being discharged by the upflowing hot waters may be 175-210 MWt.

However, the Organization of these resources for the good of population needs improvement. One of potential useful resources for Albania is thermal waters which covers whole country. Purpose of the study to discover this potential and understand consumers' approach to the use of these resources. Secondary data collection is an important part for study of condition in terms of usage of thermal waters. For better understanding of consumer perception on thermal bathes, a questionnaire is collected. By this survey, we tried to understand reasons behind few visits to thermal bathes and how the industry may be developed. Research showed that infrastructure (e.g. roads) and facilities (e.g. sport and leisure) offered by touristic centers using thermal waters need improvement for responding to consumers' needs. Strategies pursued by these businesses have to be revisited. Our research focused on thermal springs and its usage in Albania which creates geographical limitations for the work. However we tried to add global perspective by studying global experiences in the field. Generally, literature on thermal resources is lacking in Albania. Even globally, this is not an attractive topic for academicians. Especially, marketing perspective needs attention. Consumer as an important factor in this process is mainly ignored. This study is pioneering consumer research in thermal spring hotel market.

J	Pasvanoglu, S; Guner, A; Gultekin, F				Pasvanoglu, Suzan; Guner, Ahmet; Gultekin, Fatma			Environmental problems at the Nevsehir (Kozakli) geothermal field, central Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Sinkhole; Thermal spring; Nevsehir; Kozakli; Turkey	WATERS	The Kozakli-NevAYehir geothermal field extends a long a NW-SE direction at SE of the Centrum of Kozakli. The area is not rugged and average elevation is 1,000 m. The Kozanozu Creek flows towards north of the area. In the Kozakli thermal Spa area, thermal waters are manifested along a valley with a length of 1.5 km and 200 m width. In this resort some hot waters are discharged with no use. The thermal water used in the area comes from wells drilled by MTA. In addition, these waters from wells are also utilized by hotels, baths and motels belonging to City Private Management, Municipality and private sector. The measured temperature of Kozakli waters ranges from 43-51A degrees C in springs and 80-96A degrees C in wells. Waters are issued in a wide swampy area as a small group of springs through buried faults. Electrical conductivity values of thermal spring and well waters are 1,650-3,595 mu S/cm and pH values are 6.72-7.36. Kozakli cold water has an electrical conductivity value of 450 mu S/cm and pH of 7.56. All thermal waters are dominated by Na+ and Cl-SO4 while cold waters are dominated by Ca+2 and HCO3 (-). The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental problems around the Kozakli geothermal field and explain the mechanisms of karstic depression which was formed by uncontrolled use of thermal waters in this area and bring up its possible environmental threats. At the Kozakli geothermal field a sinkhole with 30 m diameter and 15 m depth occurred in January, 17th 2007 at the recreation area located 20 m west of the geothermal well which belongs to the government of NevAYehir province. The management of the geothermal wells should be controlled by a single official institution in order to avoid the creation of such karstic structures affecting the environment at the source area.

For this purpose, experimental studies were conducted on a coal sample containing high ash and sulfur contents. The effects of pH, solid concentration, collector amount and frother amount on the flotation were investigated separately in Mediterranean Sea water, Cermik thermal spring water, snow water and tap water. Flotation, results indicated that, when comparing the various water mediums, the following order for the ash content was obtained: snow water < Cermik thermal spring water < tap water < the Mediterranean Sea water. For the reduction of total sulfur, the following order was obtained: snow water > Cermik thermal spring water > Mediterranean Sea water > tap water. When snow water was used as a flotation medium, it was found that a concentrate containing 3.01% total sulfur and 27.64% ash with a total sulfur reduction of 57.06% was obtained from a feed containing 7.01% total sulfur and 4.1.17% ash.

Conditions and possibilities of direct utilisation of thermal-mineral waters in Raska region, Serbia	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Serbia; Raska; Thermal spring; Spa; Utilisation		The natural thermal-mineral springs in the Raska region in Serbia have been known since the ancient period. Temperatures of these sources between 26 degrees C and 51 degrees C have allowed the use of water for balneology and recreational purposes. Research over the past 50 years have pointed to the existence of significant amounts of thermal-mineral waters that occur in different tectonic zones and faults in the Dinarides. Bearing in mind the properties of thermal-mineral waters the paper deals with possibilities of their use as a renewable resource. The paper analyses the way of use of waters in three spas and one spring for health and recreational purposes and presents the possibilities for improving the use of unused water. The results hint at the possibility of direct use of heat energy from TM sources and substitution of fossil fuels, expenses of living and work in local communities. Direct use of geothermal energy, especially during the colder period of the year, would reduce the expenses of heating of public institutions, services and private households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This covers part of the air conditioning needs of the building and of the heating of thermal water to the appropriate temperature for therapeutic use. In the first part of the study, an analysis of the spring's situation was made, calculating the thermal water needs and presenting the consumption according to the operation schedule on different types of day. In this way, the contribution the spring was capable of giving was compared and the evolution of the thermal water in the tanks was studied. In the second part, the climatic conditions that the spa should meet are studied, along with the loads that it should support, the energy reclaimed from the different heat focuses and the repercussions on the final solution.

Low-temperature geothermal system of Ilica (Erzurum, Turkey) located along the Eastern Anatolian fault zone was investigated for hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics. The study of ionic and isotopic contents shows that the thermal water of Ilica is mainly, locally fed by groundwater, which changes chemically and isotopically during its circulation within the major fault zone reaching depths. The thermal spring has a temperature of 29-39 A degrees C, with electrical conductivity ranging from 4,000 to 7,510 A mu S/cm and the thermal water is of Na-HCO3-Cl water type. The chemical geothermometers applied in the Ilica geothermal waters yielded a maximum reservoir temperature of 142 A degrees C according to the silica geothermometers. The thermal waters are undersaturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite and halite, and oversaturated with respect to dolomite. The dolomite mineral possibly caused scaling when obtaining the thermal waters in the study area. According to the enthalpy chloride-mixing model, cold water to the thermal water-mixing ratio is changing between 69.8 and 75 %. The delta O-18-delta H-2 compositions obviously indicate meteoric origin of the waters. Thermal water springs derived from continental precipitation falling on to higher elevations in the study area. The delta C-13 ratio for dissolved inorganic carbonate in the waters lies between 4.63 and 6.48 aEuro degrees. In low-temperature waters carbon is considered as originating from volcanic (mantle) CO2.

The Li isotopic composition of lake water has not varied significantly over a 4 year meromictic period (delta(7)Li similar to + 19.5). Springs are isotopically distinct: groundwater springs and seeps carry water enriched in isotopically heavy Li whereas thermal springs supply isotopically light (delta(7) Li < lake), but 10 times more Li-rich, water. Isotopic fractionation during crystallization of carbonate tufa and evaporitic salt appears to be insignificant, and thus cannot be called on as a principal control of the isotopic balance of Li of the lake. Isotopic differences between the end-member source components permit a water budget to be calculated, suggesting (1) springs provide > 50% of the Li to the lake; (2) the Li budget is sensitively balanced on small thermal spring contributions, < 3% of the total spring inflow; and (3) the residence time of Li in the lake is 28 ka. Other Great Basin closed lakes have variable Li isotopic compositions ( &delta;Li-7 from + 16.7 to +23.7), all of which differ significantly from those of several major takes and seawater (homogeneously &SIM; +32).

All springs emerge along faults, which have the potential to transmit waters rapidly from great depths. However, mixing with shallow meteoric waters within the flow system results in uncertainty in the interpretation of geochemical results. The chemical compositions of cold and warm springs and geothermal waters are varied, but overall there is a trend from Ca-HCO3 dominated to Na-Cl dominated. There is little difference in the seasonal ionic compositions of the hot springs, suggesting the waters are sourced from a well-mixed reservoir. Based on delta O-18 and delta H-2 concentrations, all waters are of meteoric origin with evidence of temperature equilibration with carbonate rocks and evaporation. Seasonal isotopic variability indicates that only a small proportion of late spring and summer precipitation forms recharge and that fresh meteoric waters move rapidly into the flow system and mix with thermal waters at depth. H-3 and percent modern carbon (pmC) values reflect progressively longer groundwater pathways from cold to geothermal waters; however, mixing processes and the very high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the water samples preclude the use of either isotope to gain any insight on actual groundwater ages.

This group of springs lies within a geothermal zone having exceptionally high heat flow about 230 mW/m(2), resembling young oceanic ridges. The spring gas has a high radon activity (similar to 885 kBq/m(3)) and is rich in helium (similar to 1.4 vol.%) with appreciably large flow rate. The measured radon exhalation rates in the soils of the spring area show extensive variations from 831 to 4550/mBqm(2) h while Rn-222 concentrations in the different spring waters vary from 3.18 to 46.9 kBq/m(3). Surface air at a radius of 40 m around the springs, within which is situated the Bakreswar temple complex and a group of dwellings, has radon concentration between 450 and 500 Bq/m(3). In the present paper we assess the radon activity background in and around the spring area due to the different contributing sources and its possible effect on visiting pilgrims and the people who reside close to the springs.

A series of temperature variations (from 2013 to 2017) in four spring water sources at the Strengbach Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) was analyzed and interpreted by relying upon a coupled two-dimensional unsaturated-saturated flow and heat transfer model specifically designed for the study. Temperature variations of spring waters at the Strengbach catchment obey a seasonal non-phased and attenuated cyclicity compared with temperature inputs from the air or very shallow waters in soils. Simulation results show that, within the shallow subsurface horizons, heat transfer is mainly controlled by thermal conduction and not by fluid flow. The results also emphasize that the depth and temperature value of the thermal invariance zone are key parameters to surface temperature atten-uation patterns in the first meters beneath the surface. The average maximum porosity (or saturated water content) is another important parameter impacting heat transfers in the shallow subsurface. Stronger attenua-tions and delays of the thermal signal occur as the porosity increases. These different results indicate that temperature variations in the spring waters, especially the attenuation and phase shift of the signals compared with incoming air-surface water temperatures, do not bring information on hydrological transfers. In very shallow systems, characteristics, such as flow velocities and water residence times, cannot be inferred from temperature variations. Nevertheless, this study suggests that spring water temperature variations could become a way of identifying the usually poorly known saturated water content and its spatial variability at the catchment scale.

Health benefits are attributed to thermal spring water containing radioactive elements such as radium; this has popularized use of such radioactive water in various parts of the world, causing those who ingest it to increase their internal radiation dose. The goal of this study was to assess the activity concentrations of Ra-226 present in the thermal spring waters of San Diego de Alcala, in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, and to estimate the health risk posed to patients by the effective dose received from ingesting this water during hydropinic treatments. Water samples were taken from different areas of the San Diego de Alcala thermal springs, and pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids were measured. The Ra-226 activity concentrations were measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The activity concentrations of Ra-226 in sampled water varied from 125 to 452 mBq L-1 with an average of 276 +/- 40 mBq L-1. The committed effective dose from each of the Ra-226 activity concentrations found in samples ranged from 9.80 x 10(-5) to 4.0 x 10(-3) mSv for hydropinic treatments being carried out in San Diego de Alcala thermal spring spas. Different treatments had different intake rates (200, 600, 1,000, and 1,500 mL d(-1)) and occurred over periods of 2 or 3 wk. According to the guidelines of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the maximum permissible amount of radium in drinking water is 185 mBq L-1; the Ra-226 content in most of the collected samples exceeded this limit. The committed effective doses varied with Ra-226 concentration and intake rate; none exceeded the World Health Organization's reference dose for drinking water of 0.1 mSv y(-1), which is the maximum amount to which the population should be exposed.

Sixty water and sediment samples were collected from bicarbonate, sulphur, and sodium chloride thermal springs in the northwest. All hot springs examined are used mainly for health purposes in Iran. Acanthamoeba were identified by both morphology and PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Genotype identification was based on the sequencing of a highly variable and informative region of Diagnostic Fragment 3 (stem 29-1 of 18S rRNA gene) within Acanthamoeba-specific amplimer (ASA.S1). Twenty percent of hot springs were contaminated with thermotolerant Acanthamoeba belonging to the potentially pathogenic T4 and T3 genotypes. A high number (91.7%) of strains showed growth at 37 degrees C, and eight isolates showed growth at 42 degrees C. A single isolate (HSNW2) was detected in waters at 70 degrees C. The presence of thermotolerant Acanthamoeba highlights a risk factor for susceptible individuals, as Acanthamoeba-related keratitis continues to rise in Iran. Periodic surveillance of thermal waters as well as improved filtration and disinfection is recommended to prevent disease related to pathogenic Acanthamoeba. This is the first comprehensive molecular study of Acanthamoeba genotypes in hot springs in Iran and the first to report the occurrence of the T3 genotype (corresponding to Acanthamoeba griffini) in thermal water sources in this country.

The ratio showed a trimodal distribution for the case of thermal/mineral water: 0.7052-0.7053 (Type A, Zao hot spring), 0.7039-0.7043 (Type B, Okama crater lake and Shin-funkiko hot spring), and 0.7070-0.7073 (Type C, Gaga, Aone, and Togatta hot springs), respectively. However, in comparison, the ratio was found to be higher for meteoric waters (0.7077-0.7079). The water from the central volcanic edifice (Type B) was found to be similar to that of nearby volcanic rocks in their Sr isotopic ratio. This indicates that the Sr in water was derived from shallow volcanic rocks. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio for water from the Zao hot spring (Type A) was intermediate between those of the pre-Tertiary granitic and the Quaternary volcanic rocks, thus suggesting that the water had reacted with both volcanic and granitic rocks. The location of the vapor-liquid separation was determined as the boundary of the pre-Tertiary granitic and the Quaternary volcanic rocks by comparing the results of this strontium isotopic study with those of Kiyosu and Kurahashi [Kiyosu, Y., Kurahashi, M., 1984.

Four thermal springs are of the Na-HCO3 type and contain minor elements (Si, Sr, F, Li, Cs), while other water samples (including eleven well samples and five cold springs with temperatures ranging from 22.2 degrees C to 28.4 degrees C, named cold groundwater) have more complex hydrochemical characteristics. The results show that all water samples are of meteoric origin. Most water samples can be grouped into two groups in a plot of oxygen and hydrogen isotope data. Thermal water, all cold springs, and part of the well water samples fall into the same group. A simple binary mixing model based on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes was used to calculate the mixing ratio of groundwater with thermal water. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Yuan, J.

The hot water in the geothermal field of basin-type discharges partly in the form of the Xiaotangshan hot spring under natural conditions. The hot water has TDS of less than 600 mg/L and is of Na center dot Ca-HCO3 type. The geothermal water receives recharge from precipitation in the mountain area with elevation of about 500 m above sea level to the north of the spring. Thermal groundwater flows slowly south and southeast through a deep circulation with a residence time of 224 years estimated with the Ra-Rn method. The Xiaotangshan hot spring dried up in the middle of the 1980s owing to the increasing withdrawal of the hot water in the geothermal field in the past decades. The water level of the geothermal system still falls continually at an annual average rate of about 2 m, although water temperature changes very little, indicating that the recharge of such a geothermal system of basin-type is limited. Over-exploitation has a dramatic impact on the geothermal system, and reduction in exploitation and reinjection are required for the sustainable usage of the hot water.

The presence of radon in thermal and in mineral waters may result in an additional exposure to natural radiation due to both indoor radon and radon decay products present in the environmental air of spas facilities; health effects from exposure to radon in thermal spas depend mainly on radon inhalation. In fact, the European Commission has identified thermal spas as one the professional activities with higher exposure to radon. The purpose of this work was to access the concentration of radon in mineral waters from Portuguese thermal spas. A set of measurements for radon concentration levels in ground water are presented. The measurements were carried out at several locations from different thermal spas: perforation, spring, ORL (thermal inhalation therapy room) and vichy shower, between November 2013 and May 2014. Radon concentration in thermal water presented a wide range of variation, ranging between 23 Bq/L and 3601 Bq/L, which is above the European Commission recommendation value of 1000 Bq/L for drinking water (2001/928/EURATOM).

All these waters discharge from the overturned limb of the Simano nappe, probably dose to the contact between basement and underlying cover rocks. They therefore represent rain waters that descend slowly, heat at depth and locally rise relatively quickly to the surface, preserving part of their physical and chemical characteristics.

Most geothermal springs in southern Tibet, China, have notably high Li contents, but the fluids' Li origins and enrichment processes remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the Li enrichment mechanisms in the study area based on 307 hydrogeochemical data of thermal spring waters selected from the literature. Our findings confirm that most Li-enriched geothermal springs in southern Tibet are chemically influenced by magma. Also, K-Mg and chalcedony geothermometers' estimates indicated that most of the springs originate from shallow reservoirs with temperatures below 200 ?, although some higher temperature deep reservoirs may exist beneath Tibet. Moreover, we found that two hydrochemical processes mainly resulted in the relatively high Li concentrations in southern Tibet's thermal fluids. First, magmatic Li enrichment resulted from the semi-molten state magma degassing rather than leaching from the surrounding rocks in the deeper reservoirs. Subsequent mixing of the Li-rich deep fluids with varying amounts of infiltrating groundwater formed the shallow reservoirs during ascent to the earth's surface resulting in the observed differences in Li concentrations of the thermal springs from these reservoirs. Secondly, evaporation further concentrated the Li in the Li-rich geothermal springs in southern Tibet, resulting in higher Li levels than in other magmatic thermal springs. The present study could not establish the Li source for the Tibet thermal springs with low Cl concentrations because they may mix with large amounts of infiltrating groundwater; however, it is more likely that magmatic Li still accounts for a large portion of the total Li.

Nepal has many such natural hot water springs among which few are famous for therapeutic purposes. Thousands of people with some musculoskeletal problem visit those places in the hope of getting rid of their problems. This study aimed to understand their belief in such therapies, expectations, and satisfaction after treatment along with their knowledge of the safety of hot spring water bath. Among 126 participants interviewed, 31% had inflammatory arthritis, followed by degenerative disorders in 29.4% and soft-tissue rheumatism in 12.7%. Around three-quarters believed that hot spring water has natural healing power and thus can improve their pain. Many even believed that water in natural springs is devoid of any chemicals. So, it is a safe treatment option. Regarding the expectation of cure, they had mixed opinions. Naive participants hoped they might find a permanent cure in thermal baths. However, repeated visitors said that the effect usually lasted for a few months and they have to visit there regularly. Almost two-thirds of people thought that such natural treatment does not have any side effects. Few stated that they had faced certain problems after the treatment. The water tested from the study site showed that it contained a higher amount of chlorine and sulfate in comparison to other hot water springs in Nepal. The minerals present in water might be a cause of temporary relief of pain. Also, outbreaks of infection from common spring baths have to be considered as such cases have been reported in the past. In conclusion, the medicinal benefits of such natural hot water springs have to be studied further and awareness regarding safety should be given to the people seeking treatment.

Here we investigate the timing of the runoff event vis-a-vis formation of the thermal bar and quantify its impact on the fate of materials of terrestrial origin (TSS, total suspended solids) in the nearshore waters of Lake Superior. It was estimated that the spring runoff event delivers an average of 70% of the annual TSS load for a 33-year period of record (1966-1998). The average dates for the midpoint of the spring runoff event and thermal bar formation are 9 April (range, mid-March to late April) and 2 May (range, early April to late May), respectively. This offset of 3-4 weeks provides an opportunity for materials which are discharged and retained in suspension by wave action to be transported from the nearshore before trapping by the thermal bar can occur. Model calculations indicate that 23 +/- 28% (range < 1% to > 99%) of the spring runoff event TSS loading remains available for trapping at the time of thermal bar formation. In terms of mass, predicted retention varied from negligible amounts to in excess of 700,000 metric tons. The spring runoff event is predicted to have the potential to raise average nearshore TSS levels more than 4.1 +/- 2.7 times above background levels and to sustain that elevation for more than 60 days. The range in the nearshore TSS response reflects interannual variability in the magnitude of the spring runoff event and its timing relative to the formation of the thermal bar.

NEW APPROACHES CHARACTERIZING GROUNDWATER FLOW, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	31st International-Association-of-Hydrogeologists Congress	SEP 10-14, 2001	MUNICH, GERMANY	Int Assoc Hydrogeologists, Assoc Tracer Hydrologists			SPITSBERGEN; HYDROCHEMISTRY	Trollkjeldene, Jotunkjeldene and Gygrekjelda are groups of low temperature (< 25.6 degreesC) thermal springs, with major travertine mound and terrace development, on the prominent Breibogen-Bockfjorden fault in a recently volcanically active area of northern Svalbard. The likely Quaternary history of the springs supports current models of recharge beneath temperate zones of glaciers being enhanced during glacial periods. The chemistry of the springs can be explained by (i) chloride salinity being derived from a seawater source and (ii) major ions being modified by water-rock interaction at depth in a (possibly gneissic) reservoir, while (iii) trace elements indicate modification of water chemistry during its ascent through marble strata.

Initiated during the Variscan earth movements and reactivated in Miocene times, the structure, which extends across the English Channel to France, is still active. With this discovery, it should now be possible to throw fresh light on the origin and movement of the thermal water at Bath and thus to protect the hot springs from derogation by limestone quarrying.											22	5	5	0	3	SPRINGER VERLAG	NEW YORK	175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010	0177-5146			ENVIRON GEOL	Environ.

Discharge temperatures of these springs are 44 and 29 degreesC, respectively, and bathing is their traditional use. Drilling performed during the last three decades in the above-mentioned and other localities revealed considerable amounts of thermal waters occurring in tectonically disturbed zones of Sudetic metamorphic rocks and granitoids. The existence of thermal waters may also be expected in numerous areas of the Sudetes where carbonated waters occur. CO2 connected with Tertiary and Pleistocene basic magmatism may be an indicator of regional rock heating. Another potential area of geothermal interest is the Fore-Sudetic block, where thermal carbonated water was discovered in the vicinity of a cluster of Tertiary basaltic cones and where hydrothermal activity of Tertiary to mid-Quaternary age took place.

JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article							ISOTOPES; HELIUM; GASES; HEAT	Anomalous N-2/Ar values occur in many thermal springs and mineral springs, some volcanic fumaroles, and at least one acid-sulfate spring of the Cascade Range. Our data show that N-2/Ar values are as high as 300 in gas from some of the hot springs, as high as 1650 in gas from some of the mineral springs, and as high as 2400 in gas from the acid-sulfate spring on Mt. Shasta. In contrast, gas discharging from hot springs that contain nitrogen and argon solely of atmospheric origin typically exhibits N-2/Ar values of 40-80, depending on the spring temperature. If the excess nitrogen in the thermal and mineral springs is of sedimentary origin then the geothermal potential of the area must be small, but if the nitrogen is of volcanic origin then the geothermal potential must be very large. End-member excess nitrogen (delta(15)N) is +5.3parts per thousand for the thermal waters of the Oregon Cascades but is only about +1parts per thousand for fumaroles on Mt. Hood and the acid-sulfate spring on Mt. Shasta. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations are highest for thermal springs associated with aquifers between 120 and 140degreesC. Chloride is the major anion in most of the nitrogen-rich springs of the Cascade Range, and N-2/Ar values generally increase as chloride concentrations increase. Chloride and excess nitrogen in the thermal waters of the Oregon Cascades probably originate in an early Tertiary marine formation that has been buried by the late Tertiary and Quaternary lava flows of the High Cascades. The widespread distribution of excess nitrogen that has been generated in low to moderate-temperature sedimentary environments is further proof of the restricted geothermal potential of the Cascade Range.

Quaternary sand and gravel occur in the valley which is underlain by the red beds consisting of sandstone and mudstone. The temperature of the hot spring is 42.1 degrees C. The spring water has a pH value of 6.41, TDS of 3.98 g/L, F contents of 3.08 mg/L, and H2SiO3 of 35.6 mg/L. The hot water is of SO4 center dot Cl-Na center dot Ca type. There is a slight hydrogen sulfide odor in the spring water. Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate that the hot water is of meteoric origin. It is estimated that the elevation of the recharge area of the hot spring is approximately 3800 m, the age of the hot water is some 140 years, the temperature of the geothermal reservoir is 75 degrees C-80 degrees C, the mixture ratio of cold water is approximately 80%, and the circulation depth of the thermal groundwater is 1870 m. After receiving recharge from infiltration of precipitation in the mountainous recharge areas, the groundwater undergoes a deep circulation, obtains heat from the heat flow, flows upward along the fractured zone, and emerges as an upflow spring through the Quaternary sand and gravel in the central low-lying river valley.

The specific lithological and petrological features of these deposits have few counterparts in the marine, and continental, karst-related carbonates, but they are typical of the epigean limestone that has been quarried since antiquity in the surroundings of Tivoli (Rome) under the name of travertine, where it is still forming in hydro-geothermal fields linked to extensional tectonics. The physicochemical, hydrodynamic and geological conditions specific to the Tivoli thermal spring system imply hypersaturated alkaline-sulphate, warm to hot waters, upwelling from springs fed through open fractures/faults in extensional and/or volcanic regimes. These features, together with the hydrodynamic behaviour of the water flows running from the vents, control the petrogenetic features of the travertine, a well-bedded, mostly finely laminated, porous but quite compact limestone. The results of a detailed comparative petrological analysis carried out on the lithofacies of travertine limestones, and of those observed during formation within numerous active thermal spring fields, provide the elements required for an exhaustive textural classification of the travertine lithofacies, which has not yet been described systematically. According to the genetic processes and fabrics, the thermal deposits that originate from such hypersaturated alkaline-sulphate, warm to hot waters, can be subdivided into: abiotic crystalline crusts, microbially mediated crusts (microbialites) and granular deposits mostly represented by small accumulations of lime-mudstone. Some of the granular deposits and the microbialites are only partially comparable with analogous sediments forming on tidal flats/sabkhas or other continental sites; however, the facies association of crystalline crusts and laminar curled microbialites has no counterpart in the marine realm. The widespread presence of thermophile bacteria and sulphobacteria, and the general absence of autochthonous eukaryote organisms, unable to live in poisonous sulphate waters, are also undeniable evidence of their thermal origin.

NOV.; HYPERTHERMOPHILIC ARCHAEON; HYDROTHERMAL VENT; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; THERMAL SPRINGS; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; BACTERIUM; TEMPERATURE	The hot springs are populated by mesophilic, thermotolerant, and hyperthermophilic bacteria. These populations are diverse, and some of them show combinations of other extreme conditions, for example, acidic, alkaline, high pressure, and high concentrations of salts and heavy metals. Anaerobes inhabiting hot springs are considered to be the closest living descendants of the earliest living forms on earth, and their study offers understandings about the origin and evolution of life. In this chapter, thermal spring bacterial diversity from Pakistani ecology is reviewed. The bacterial populations in Pakistani hydrothermal vent environments showed a great genetic diversity, and most members of these populations appeared to be uncultivated and unidentified organisms. Analysis suggested that some microorganisms of novel phylotypes predicted by molecular phylogenetic analysis were likely present in thermal spring environments. Libraries were predominantly composed of rare phylotypes that appeared to be unclassified, and the number and type of phylotypes observed were correlated with biogeography as well as biogeochemistry. These findings broaden our opinion of the genetic diversity of bacteria in hot water spring environments. The global-scale bacterial diversity of other hot water spring environments, on the other hand, may be beyond present proficiencies for authentic study.

METHODS: The fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) enriched with fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and l-glutamine and in DMEM diluted with spring water at different concentrations. RESULTS: our results suggest the active role of different partial replacements of DMEM with the comano spring water in regulating the vitality of the human fibroblast cultures. The 20% replacement of DMEM with spring water demonstrated a relevant increase in the cell vitality vs. the cultures with DMEM alone. this favorable effect seems to start at 48 hours, peaks at 72 hours and persists up to 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: these effects match the results of the previous in vivo animal study.

A significant number of thermal springs is located in its vicinity, causing increasing interests in determining the pos sibilities for the use of this resource for electricity generation. The Macizo Volcanico dei Ruiz represents the superficial manifestation of an active magma chamber with acidic evolution characteristics. The chamber is emplaced in a shallow crustal level with capacity to provide heat to its vicinity The geochemical study showed two independent fluid circulation systems at the Macizo del Ruiz. One of them corresponds to the sulfate water type, which is located N of the volcano. The other system represents the chloride water type, which is located W of the volcano. The thermal springs of the zone consist of mixtures with variable proportions of geothermal water with superficial water. The geothermal water comes from a reservoir with an estimated minimal temperature of 235 degrees C and a silica concentration of 408 mg/kg. The fraction of the hot component for the Botero Londono springs samples was estimated as 0.36. This fact explains the high temperature of these springs.

The influence of poorly interconnected fault zone flow paths on spring geochemistry	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						fault zones; mixing; permeability; springs; stable isotopes	PERMEABILITY STRUCTURE; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; COAST RANGES; FLUID-FLOW; MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN; CALIFORNIA; WATERS; ARCHITECTURE; PRESSURE; HAYWARD	Thermal springs commonly occur along faults because of the enhanced vertical permeability afforded by fracture zones. Field and laboratory studies of fault zone materials document substantial heterogeneities in fracture permeabilities. Modeling and field studies of springs suggest that spatial variations in permeability strongly influence spring locations, discharge rates and temperatures. The impact of heterogeneous permeability on spring geochemistry, however, is poorly documented. We present stable isotope and water chemistry data from a series of closely spaced thermal springs associated with the Hayward Fault, California. We suggest that substantial spatial variations observed in delta O-18 and chloride values reflect subsurface fluid transport through a poorly connected fracture network in which mixing of subsurface waters remains limited. Our measurements provide insight into the effect of fracture zone heterogeneities on spring geochemistry, offer an additional tool to intuit the nature of tectonically induced changes in fault zone plumbing, and highlight the need to consider local variations when characterizing fracture zone fluid geochemistry from spring systems with multiple discharge sites.

The main objective of the work was to characterize geothermal resources to be exploited in the future The investigated zones were: Tutupaca and Rio Calientes-Ancocollo-Challapalca. Thermal waters from Tutupaca showed low pH values and they were classified as sulphate type waters. Thermal springs from the Rio Calientes zone showed almost neutral pH values and they were classified as sodium chloride type waters with a probably geothermal origin. Reservoir temperatures were estimated and the results indicated that water-rock equilibrium in the hydrothermal system was not completely attained. Taking into account the chemical composition of some equilibrated or 'mature' waters from the Rio Calientes zone, reservoir temperatures in the range of 210-240 degrees C were estimated. Mixing models based on silica, chloride and specific enthalpy of the samples were used to estimate the composition of the reservoir liquid. Isotopic data showed oxygen-18 shift for the waters from Rio Calientes-Ancocollo regarding the waters from Tutupaca tone which were found on the world meteoric line.

In this paper, we describe the 'Bagneres-de-Bigorre' springs which occur in a remarkably active seismotectonic context. A chemical and isotopic study of 15 spring waters (both cold and thermal, ranging in temperature from 7.0 to 49.9degreesC), and continuous monitoring of a single spring allow us to characterise water-rock interactions, fluids paths and mixing processes. Three groups of waters are distinguished: (1) SO42+-Ca2+-Cl- thermal waters (II) SO42+-Cl--Ca2+ thermal waters and (III) HCO3--Ca2+ cold shallow waters. Their characteristics suggest interactions with Mesozoic evaporite and carbonate formations. O and D isotopes from thermal waters indicate a local meteoric origin of Atlantic signature and a recharge elevation of 800 to 1000 m, which corresponds to a single feeding area. Their delta(13)C values (-2.8 to -9.6parts per thousand) are consistent with carbonate dissolution, slight fractionation and a surficial organic input leading to delta(13)C depletion. Sr isotopes (0.70751 to 0.70777), Na+/Cl- and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/SO42- ratios as well as thermodynamic calculations show that the dissolution of anhydrite and halite-bearing Triassic layers control the chemical composition of group-I and -II waters. The contrasting trends of cation/Cl- ratios and TDS of waters from groups I and II suggest the existence of two different circulation paths at depth as well as dilution with surficial waters similar to group III. Calculated mixing proportions show that three waters from group I are diluted from 17 to 66%, whereas all waters from group II are mixed. The aquifer temperature is estimated to be in the range 55-64degreesC using the retrograde and prograde solubilities of anhydrite and chalcedony, respectively. Accordingly, the mean depth of the reservoir is around 1.7 km, which allows us to constrain the depth of the Triassic layer.

These waters of Dokuzpinar cold spring (DPS) (12-13 degrees C), Yesilhisar mineral spring (YMS) (13-16 degrees C), Acisu mineral spring (ACMS) (20-22.5 degrees C), Tekgoz thermal spring (TGS) (40-41 degrees C), and Bayramhaci thermal-mineral spring (BTMS) (45-46.5 degrees C) have different physical and chemical compositions. The waters are located within the Erciyes basin in the Central Anatolian Crystalline complex consisting of three main rock units. Metamorphic/crystalline rocks occur as the basement, sedimentary rocks of Upper Cretaceous-Quaternary age form the cover, and volcanosedimentary rocks Miocene-Quaternary in age represent the extrusive products of magmatism acting in that period. All these units are covered unconformably by terrace and alluvial deposits, and travertine occurrences have variable permeability. Dokuzpinar cold spring, YMS and ACMS localized mainly along the faults within the region have higher Na+ and Cl- contents whereas TGS and BTMS have higher amounts of Ca2+ and HCO3-. The high concentrations of Ca2+ and HCO3- are mainly related to the high CO2 contents resulting from interactions with carbonate rocks. Whereas the high Na+ content is derived from the alkaline rocks, such as syenite, tuff and basalts, the Cl- is generally connected to the dissolution of the evaporitic sequences. These waters are of meteoric-type. BTMS deviates from meteoric water line. The content is related to the increases in the 6180 compositions due to mineral-water interaction (re-equilibrium) process. CO2-dominated YMS and ACMS with low temperatures have higher mineralizations. Yesilhisar mineral spring, ACMS, TGS and BTMS are oversaturated in terms of calcite, aragonite, dolomite, goethite and hematite, and undersaturated with respect to gypsum, halite and anhydrite. Yesilhisar mineral spring, ACMS and BTMS are also characterized by recent travertine precipitation. Dokuzpinar cold spring is undersaturated in terms of the above minerals. The higher ratios of Ca/Mg and Cl/HCO3, and lower ratios of SO4/Cl in BTMS than TGS suggest that TGS has shallow circulation compared to BTMS, and/or has much more heat-loss enroute the surface. The sequence of hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions of the waters is in an order of DPS > YMS > ACMS > TGS > BTMS and this suggests a transition period from a shallow circulation to a deep circulation path.

J	Yeh, HF; Hsu, HH				Yeh, Hsin-Fu; Hsu, Hung-Hsiang			Analysis of Hydrothermal Systems Beneath Tayukeng through Long-Term Geochemical Signals of Hydrothermal Fluids in Tatun Volcano Group, Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						thermal water; hydrochemistry; Tayukeng; Tatun volcano group	HOT-SPRINGS; GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS; NORTHERN TAIWAN; TEMPERATURE; EQUILIBRIA; FUMAROLES; EVOLUTION; INSIGHTS; WATERS; CRATER	The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) is located in northern Taiwan and consists of many springs and fumaroles. The Tayukeng (TYK) area is the most active fumarole site in the TVG. In this study, we analyzed the long-term geochemical variations of hydrothermal fluids and proposed a mechanism responsible for the variation in TYK. There are two different aquifers beneath the TYK area: a shallow SO42--rich aquifer and a deeper aquifer rich in Cl-. TYK thermal water was mainly supplied by the shallow SO42--rich aquifer; therefore, the thermal water showed high SO42- concentrations. After 2015, the inflow of deep thermal water increased, causing the Cl- concentrations of the TYK to increase. Notably, the inferred reservoir temperatures based on quartz geothermometry increased; however, the surface temperature of the spring decreased. We inferred that the enthalpy was lost during transportation to the surface. Therefore, the surface temperature of the spring does not increase with an increased inflow of deep hydrothermal fluid. The results can serve as a reference for understanding the complex evolution of the magma-hydrothermal system in the TVG.

This study uses a classification approach and macro-scale analysis of faults and hot springs with data from the literatures and field work. By examining 68 hot springs, 6 faults, and 12 Quaternary basins in this area, controls of the northern Red River Fault Zone on the intensity of hydrothermal activity (temperature and flow rates) and distribution of hot springs are summarized. The results show that topography-related hydraulic gradients can cause geothermal water to rise after circulation. The hot springs are easy to occur along the active faults (76%), especially at fault intersections (37%). The circulation depth and elevated temperature of hot springs in the study area are positively correlated. The highest temperature hot springs correspond to low flow rates, and hot springs with the highest flow rate have low temperatures. The results are of practical significance for the search for thermal groundwater and for understanding geothermal resources potential in this area and similar areas.

J	Stober, I				Stober, Ingrid			Permeabilities and Chemical Properties of Water in Crystalline Rocks of the Black Forest, Germany	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						crystalline rocks; hydraulic properties; hydrochemical properties; Black Forest		Investigations were carried out to determine the hydraulic and hydrochemical properties of crystalline rocks in the Black Forest of Germany and neighbouring regions. Rock permeabilities (K) were determined to a depth of 3500 m. These parameters range from K = 3.5 X 10(-10) m s(-1) to K = 8.7 X 10(-5) m s(-1); and can increase up to an order of magnitude which is typical for porous aquifers. It is shown that on an average, granites are more pervious than gneisses and only the permeabilities of gneisses decrease with depth. The geochemistry of natural waters in crystalline rocks is not constant, but varies with depth and location. The concentration increases with depth and the water-type changes from a Ca-Na-HCO3-type (or Na-Ca-HCO3-) at shallow depths to a Na-Cl-type at greater depths. Thermal springs are found only in granitic rocks with on average higher permeabilities than in gneisses. Thermal waters are welling up in valleys at the bottom of steep mountains. The chemical composition of thermal spring water is identical to that of water found at greater depths. Using geothermometers it is found, that the depth of the deposits of thermal spring water in the crystalline basement rocks of the Black Forest is some 1000 m below the surface. The topographic relief in the mountains induces a deep circulation of infiltrating rain-water with an upwelling as thermal springs in the valleys.

Very high spatial resolution thermal and hyperspectral images were acquired using Thermal Airborne Broadband Imager 320 (TABI-320) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 550 (CASI-550) sensors. Extensive in situ spectroradiometer and oceanographic measurements were carried out in parallel with thermal and hyperspectral image acquisitions. Experiments and analysis of the data show that the combined use of very high spatial resolution airborne thermal and hyperspectral sensors for the detection of relatively small sub-aerial coastal springs and submarine groundwater discharges proves to be a very efficient and operational method. Very high spatial resolution thermal data were able to detect even very small coastal sub-aerial springs. On the other hand, the hyperspectral data were the most appropriate for detecting relatively small submarine groundwater discharges, which were not detected on thermal imagery, due to the increase in turbidity that these discharges cause. This is confirmed by the strong correlations between the hyperspectral data and the in situ measured turbidity-related water inherent optical properties.

Deep geoelectrical investigation to bound a coastal thermal outflow area	25TH SALT WATER INTRUSION MEETING (SWIM 2018)	E3S Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	25th Salt Water Intrusion Meeting (SWIM)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Gdansk, POLAND					The coastal carbonate Apulian aquifers, located in southern Italy, feed several coastal fresh springs and constitute the main local source of high quality water. The Santa Cesarea Terme cave system is almost unique case of hypogenic coastal spring caves, located along the Adriatic Sea coastline and hosting spring coastal outflow of mixed groundwater (from 22 degrees C to 33 degrees C) mainly of thermal groundwater due to infiltration offshore, in the sea bottom, and pure fresh groundwater due rainfall infiltration. Thermal springs and the outflow system are strictly controlled by both the discontinuity network and the karst processes involving the foreland environment. Detailed geoelectrical prospecting were carried out to bound the upflow continental area of this system, considering the geoelectrical effects of deep water mixing with different salinity and temperature close the Adriatic coast.

J	Horvat, B; Rubinic, J				Horvat, Bojana; Rubinic, Josip			Evaluating the Applicability of Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing in Estimating Water Potential of the Karst Aquifer: A Case Study in North Adriatic, Croatia	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						karst aquifer; water potential; coastal spring; thermal infrared remote sensing; Landsat; SST	SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SPRINGS	One of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Adriatic coast, the city of Opatija, is facing a problem concerning seasonal drinking water shortages. The existing water resources are no longer sufficient, and attention is being given to alternative resources such as the underlying karstic aquifer and several coastal springs in the city itself. However, the water potential of the area still cannot be estimated due to the insufficient hydrological data. The goal of this research was to evaluate the use of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing as the source of valuable information that will improve our understanding of the groundwater discharge dynamics. Ten Landsat ETM+ (enhanced thematic mapper plus) and two Landsat TM (thematic mapper) images of the north Adriatic, recorded during 1999-2004 at the same time as the field discharge measurements, were used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) and to analyze freshwater outflows seen as the thermal anomaly in the TIR images. The approach is based on finding the functional relationship between the size of the freshwater thermal signatures and the measured discharge data, and to estimate the water potential of the underlying aquifer. It also involved analyzing the possible connection between the adjusted size of the spring's thermal signatures and groundwater level fluctuations in the deeper karst hinterland. The proposed methodology resulted in realistic discharge estimates, as well as a good fit between thermal anomalies with measured discharges and the groundwater level. It should be emphasized that the results are site specific and based on a limited data set. However, they confirm that the proposed method can provide additional information on groundwater outflow dynamics and coastal springs' freshwater quantification.

Conditions for the Formation of the Chemical Composition of the Water of the Firuza MGU Carbonated Spring (Northern Pamirs)	MOSCOW UNIVERSITY GEOLOGY BULLETIN			English	Article						carbonated springs; microcomponents of underground water; chloride sodium thermal water; geothermometer; the Northern Pamir		We considered the geological conditions and chemical composition of the water of the Firuza MGU carbonated spring, which was discovered in 2015 in Northern Pamir. This paper reports on the detailed composition of the microcomponents of the water as determined by an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry analysis (ICP-MS). A comparative review of the water composition and content of similar microcomponents in waters of carbonated springs in Kamchatka and the Russian Far East is given. On the basis of the B : Cl and K : Li : Rb : Cs ratios, which are close to the same ratios for chloride sodium hot springs in areas of active volcanism, it is concluded that the water of the spring has a deep origin. The temperature of the formation of water calculated by a Na K geothermometer method is 147.3 degrees C, suggesting the formation of the spring at a depth of approximately 5 km.	[Bychkov, A.

Places for collection of samples were chosen from different hydro-geological areas: thermal, volcanic, resurgence, middle areas, from the alluvial cone of the Adige river and from the karst formations of Montorio. As for mineral water, measurements were carried out in most of the industrial springs of this region. Large use of these waters among the people of Veneto makes this investigation more important than the Rn-222 levels observed would suggest. The analysis of some local aqueducts allowed us to complete studies of the sources and distribution of drinking water in Veneto.

The region is characterised by a low geothermal gradient and low conductive heat flux and the composition of Triponzo thermal waters significantly differs with respect to the cold waters circulating in the surrounding areas. The origin of the heat transported by the waters of the Triponzo springs is mainly due to a deep component, characterised by high CO2 and He contents, coming from a deeper reservoir, rising along normal faults and mixing with infiltrating waters of meteoric origin. The total amount of thermal water discharged by the system is about 34 L s(-1). According to the ternary SO4-2-F--HCO3-geoindicator for carbonate-evaporite reservoirs, the fluids at reservoir condition are charcterised by a partial pressure of CO2 about 0.5 bar and a temperature between 70-75 degrees C whereas the silica geothermometers give a temperature about 62 degrees C. The computed thermal energy transported by advection and discharged at the surface by Triponzo springs is about 3.71x10(11) +/- 0.56x10(11) J/day.

J	Davidson, GJ; Bavea, M; Harris, K				Davidson, Garry J.; Bavea, Michael; Harris, Kathryn			Ferruginous thermal spring complexes, northwest Tasmania: evidence that far-field stresses acting on a fracture mesh can open and maintain vertical flow in carbonate terrains	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Thermal springs; Karst; Far field stress; Hydrogeochemistry; Tasmania; Australia	DEEP GROUNDWATER-FLOW; GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES; LIMESTONE AQUIFERS; WATERS; ORIGIN; STRATIGRAPHY; DERBYSHIRE; HISTORY; ENGLAND; SYSTEM	Far-field stress changes in the southern Australian plate since 5 Ma have produced significant areas of uplift and seismicity. In northwest Tasmania, there is evidence that this stress reorientation to maximum horizontal NW-SE stress has influenced meteoric-derived thermal (15-20A degrees C) discharge patterns of confined karstic aquifers, by placing pre-existing NW-trending faults/fractures into a dilated state or a critically stressed state. Previous studies have shown that spring discharge has operated continuously for at least 65,000 years, and has transported large volumes of solutes to the surface to be deposited as mounds of calcite-goethite-silica up to 7 m high. The thermal spring chemistry at one site, Mella, is consistent with descent to at least 1.2-1.5 km, although the hinterland within 50 km is less than 500 m elevation. Thermal spring chemistry is consistent with most of the deep water-rock interaction occurring in low-strontium Smithton Dolomite. While some of this water is discharged at springs, some instead intersects shallow zones of NE-fracture-controlled rock (2 x 4 km in area) with karstic permeability where, although confined and subject to a NE-directed hydraulic gradient, it circulates and cools to ambient temperature, with only minor mixing with other groundwaters.

To assess the feasibility of geothermal development, we applied integrated multicomponent geothermometry (IMG) in the program GeoT to estimate the geothermal reservoir temperatures for four major thermal springs in this area. Numerical optimizations of Al and HCO3- concentrations, dilutions, and steam fractions were conducted to reconstruct the original deep fluid compositions by the IMG method. The results show that the geothermal reservoir temperatures of these springs range from 118 to 172 degrees C in the Changbai Mountain volcanic region. In contrast to classic geothermometers, the IMG method can quantify processes affecting the fluid chemical composition and yield reasonable temperatures. The reservoir temperatures for the Julong and Jinjiang thermal springs are significantly greater than those for the Shibadaogou and Xianrenqiao thermal springs. Moreover, the geothermal deep circulation characteristics of the above springs are also investigated based on reservoir temperature estimates. The methods presented in this study could be applied to other geothermal fields under similar geothermal resource conditions.

These differences are the result of secondary processes such as conductive cooling, mixing with colder shallower waters, and input of external CO2, which affect each spring to a different extent in the terminal part of the thermal circuit. In this paper, the secondary processes that control the geochemical evolution of this system have been addressed using a geochemical dataset spanning over 20 years and combining different approaches: classical geochemical calculations and geochemical modelling. Mixing between a cold and a thermal end-member, cooling and CO2 exchange are the processes affecting the spring waters with different intensity over time. These differences in the intensity of the secondary processes could be controlled by the effect of climate and indirectly by the geomorphological and hydrogeological setting of the different springs Infiltration recharging the shallow aquifer is dominant during the rainy seasons and the extent of the mixing process is greater, at least in some springs. Moreover, significant rainfall can produce a decrease in the ground temperature favouring the conductive cooling. Finally, the geomorphological settings of the springs determine the thickness and the hydraulic properties of the saturated layer below them and, therefore, they affect the extent of the mixing process between the deep thermal waters and the shallower cold waters. The understanding of the compositional changes in the thermal waters and the main factors that could affect them is a key issue to plan the future management of the geothermal resources of the Caldes de Boi system. Here, we propose to use a simple methodology to assess the effect of those factors, which could affect the quality of the thermal waters for balneotherapy at long-term scale. Furthermore, the methodology used in this study can be applied to other geothermal systems.	[Asta, M. P.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, EML, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gimeno, M. J.; Auque, L.

To date, 79 localities of thermal springs in Malaysia including 20 hot springs which located in Perak have been reported. Based on a recent exploratory study, hot springs in Peninsular Malaysia are seen to have good potential to be developed into successful tourism destinations. Currently, the most visited hot springs in West Malaysia are eight fully-fledged locations without realizing there are at least 20 more potential areas to be developed or redeveloped. The authors have devised a benchmarking concept to learn from best practices of how to study the market, create a proper infrastructure, use the Japanese Onsen principles of hot springs balneology and practice hot springs management as eco-tourism. Implementing such a system, it is hoped that we can assist in developing some of the new and those unmaintained hot springs in West Malaysia to become successful tourism destinations.

The relatively high altitude northern area around the main Ngozi, Rungwe, Tukuyu and Kyejo volcanoes, is characterised by cold and gas-rich springs. In contrast, hot springs occur in the southern and low-altitude area between the Kyela and Livingstone faults. The isotopic signature of the almost stagnant, cold springs of the Northern district is clearly influenced by H2O-CO2(g) exchange as evidenced from negative oxygen-shifts in the order of few deltas permil. In contrast, the isotopic signature of waters discharged from the hot springs of the Southern district is markedly less affected by the H2O-CO2(g) interaction. This evidence is interpreted as an effect of the large, permanent outflow of these springs, which supports the hypothesis of a regional-scale recharge of the major thermal springs. Measurements of carbon isotope variations of the dissolved inorganic carbon of waters and CO2(g) from the Northern and Southern springs support a model of CO2(g)-driven reactivity all over the investigated area. Our combined chemical and isotopic results show that the composition of hot springs is consistent with a mixing between (i) cold surface fresh (SFW) and (ii) Deep Hot Mineralised (DHMW) Water, indicating that the deep-originated fluids also supply most of the aqueous species dissolved in the surface waters used as local potable water. Based on geothermometric approaches, the temperature of the deep hydrothermal system has been estimated to be higher than 110 degrees C up to 185 degrees C, in agreement with the geological and thermal setting of the Malawi rift basin. Geochemical data point to (i) a major upflow zone of geothermal fluids mixed with shallow meteoric waters in the Southern part of the province, and (ii) gas absorption phenomena in the small, perched aquifers of the Northern volcanic highlands.

Present and future thermal regimes of intertidal groundwater springs in a threatened coastal ecosystem	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SUMMER STREAM TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER TEMPERATURE; CONTINUOUS RN-222; CHONDRUS-CRISPUS; DISCHARGE; HEAT; SHALLOW; RIVER; COLD	In inland settings, groundwater discharge thermally modulates receiving surface water bodies and provides localized thermal refuges; however, the thermal influence of intertidal springs on coastal waters and their thermal sensitivity to climate change are not well studied. We addressed this knowledge gap with a field- and model-based study of a threatened coastal lagoon ecosystem in southeastern Canada. We paired analyses of drone-based thermal imagery with in situ thermal and hydrologic monitoring to estimate discharge to the lagoon from intertidal springs and groundwater-dominated streams in summer 2020. Results, which were generally supported by independent radon-based groundwater discharge estimates, revealed that combined summertime spring inflows (0.047 m(3) s(-1)) were comparable to combined stream inflows (0.050m(3) s(-1)). Net advection values for the streams and springs were also comparable to each other but were 2 orders of magnitude less than the downwelling shortwave radiation across the lagoon. Although lagoon-scale thermal effects of groundwater inflows were small compared to atmospheric forcing, spring discharge dominated heat transfer at a local scale, creating pronounced cold-water plumes along the shoreline. A numerical model was used to interpret measured groundwater temperature data and investigate seasonal and multi-decadal groundwater temperature patterns. Modelled seasonal temperatures were used to relate measured spring temperatures to their respective aquifer source depths, while multi-decadal simulations forced by historic and projected climate data were used to assess long-term groundwater warming. Based on the 2020-2100 climate scenarios (for which 5-year-averaged air temperature increased up to 4.32 degrees), modelled 5-year-averaged subsurface temperatures increased 0.08-2.23 degrees in shallow groundwater (4.2 m depth) and 0.32-1.42 degrees in the deeper portion of the aquifer (13.9 m), indicating the depth dependency of warming. This study presents the first analysis of the thermal sensitivity of groundwater-dependent coastal ecosystems to climate change and indicates that coastal ecosystem management should consider potential impacts of groundwater warming.

In 2001, 2004 and 2007 high volume high-Cl lake may be related to reactivation of high discharge (>10 kg/s) saline near-neutral water from the Soap Pool boiling springs into the lake, a few months (similar to January) after the end of the rainy season (June-October). The peak lake volume occurred in March 2007 (similar to 6 x 10(5) m(3)). Agua Tibia 2 thermal springs discharge near the foot of the SW dome but their chemistry suggests a lower temperature regime, an enhanced water-rock interaction and basement contribution (evaporites and carbonates), anhydrite leaching from the 1982 pyroclastic deposits, rather than dome activity. New suggestions of crater lake seepage are evidenced by the Agua Caliente thermal springs. Existing models on the "crater lake-Soap Pool spring" and the deep hydrothermal system are discussed. Chemical changes in the deep geothermal aquifer feeding the thermal springs may predict dome rise. Future volcanic surveillance should focus on spring chemistry variations, as well as crater lake monitoring.

S	Mahala, SC	Mahala, SC			Mahala, Subash Chandra	Mahala, SC		Characteristics of Geothermal Gases	GEOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND GENESIS OF THERMAL SPRINGS OF ODISHA, INDIA	SpringerBriefs in Earth Sciences		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter includes the type and nature of gaseous phases associated with the thermal springs of Odisha. The gases emanate along with water as bubbles causing micro rings of waves when reaches the water surface. The gases associated with thermal springs are collected in bottles by water displacement method at the point of its emergence and were analyzed for determination of gaseous composition. The constituents are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide and methane. While the nitrogen content is very high (88-90.5% by volume) the oxygen content is significantly low (1.2-6.6% by volume). Amount of helium, a rare gas is quite high in Attri (1.7%) in comparison to Deuljhori (0.768%) and Taptapani (0.269%). Methane is present as traces (0.5-0.7%). Argon content varies from 1.567% at Attri to 3.3% at Deuljhori. It is observed that percentage of nitrogen is high in thermal springs of Odisha and absence of equivalent oxygen may be due to circulation of meteoric water in the geothermal system. Sulphurous smell of the gases of thermal springs of Odisha is imparted due to possible alteration of sulphide minerals of the Easternghat rocks. Presence of helium is possibly due to disintegration of radioactive elements in Pre-cambrian terrain. Attempt at finding the causes of rise/fall of certain gas content from inside the springs have been made.											12	0	0	0	1	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							75	82		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_6	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		8	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400007
J	Ozler, HM				Ozler, HM			Hydrogeology and geochemistry in the Curuksu (Denizli) hydrothermal field, western Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						geochemistry; geology; hydrogeology; hydrothermal waters; isotopes	GEOTHERMOMETER; WATERS	Curuksu is a low temperature hydrothermal system located within the upper sector of the B. Menderes Graben. The hydrologic structure of the Curuksu hydrothermal system is largely controlled by major graben faults where it is characterized by the presence of two thermal reservoirs. One is formed by Paleozoic quartzite, schist and marble units, and the second consists of Pliocene lime-stone-travertine units. The thermal conditions inthe Curuksu region indicate that the regional tectonics and resulting local stress field control low temperatures activity. Temperatures of 30 springs emerging in the study area range between 15 and55 degrees C. These springs are classified as cold fresh, warm mineral and thermal waters. Pamukkale, Karahayit and Honaz springs are steam condensate waters, whereas Curuksu springs are commonly steam-heated waters with respect to the major anion concentrations. The reservoir temperatures have been estimated from chemical compositions by utilizing simultaneously, geothermometers andmixing models. According to these thermometric methods, the most probable subsurface temperature is in the range of 62-90 degrees C. However, the mixing models suggest a temperature level of 80 degrees C for the parent water. The system has low total dissolved solid (TDS) of similar to 1000-1500 mg/l, which indicate that these waters undergo conductive cooling within the reservoir.

J	Swanson, SK; Graham, GE				Swanson, Susan K.; Graham, Grace E.			Spring flux as an indicator of source geomorphology, substrata, and temperature conditions in springs	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Springs; Flux; Discharge; Thermal conditions; Substrata	SPECIES RICHNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOW; BIODIVERSITY; DISCHARGE; HABITATS; ECOLOGY; FLORIDA; MODEL	Spring flux (m/s), defined as spring flow (m(3)/s) divided by the area over which groundwater emerges (m(2)) at a spring, provides a meaningful way to distinguish between fracture and seepage-filtration source geomorphologies for rheocrenes in Wisconsin, USA, and may be useful in distinguishing spring source geomorphologies in other regions as well. For 20 fracture and seepage-filtration springs investigated in this study, the median spring flux for fracture springs is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the median spring flux for seepage-filtration springs, whereas median discharges are similar. Relationships were also found to exist between spring flux and spring habitat characteristics. High spring flux due to focused discharge from a few large fractures, is associated with spatial consistency in water temperature and more heterogeneous substrata near the spring source. Lower spring flux due to the emergence of water from numerous water sources across a spring pool is associated with greater spatial variation in water temperature and more homogeneous substrata near the spring source. Used in association with other environmental conditions, spring flux could be useful in predicting spring habitat conditions where detailed ecological assessments are neither available nor feasible.

J	Alt-Epping, P; Diamond, LW; Wanner, C				Alt-Epping, Peter; Diamond, Larryn W.; Wanner, Christoph			Permeability and Groundwater Flow Dynamics in Deep-Reaching Orogenic Faults Estimated From Regional-Scale Hydraulic Simulations	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						orogenic faults; geothermal system; flow modeling; transport modeling	FLUID-FLOW; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; THERMAL SPRINGS; GRIMSEL PASS; ZONE; EVOLUTION; WATER; ARCHITECTURE; CEMENTATION; TEMPERATURE	Numerical modeling is used to understand the regional scale flow dynamics of the fault-hosted orogenic geothermal system at the Grimsel Mountain Pass in the Swiss Alps. The model is calibrated against observations from thermal springs discharging in a tunnel some 250 m underneath Grimsel Pass to derive estimates for the bulk permeability of the fault. Simulations confirm that without the fault as a hydraulic conductor the thermal springs would not exist. Regional topography alone drives meteoric water in a single pass through the fault plane where it penetrates to depths exceeding 10 km and acquires temperatures in excess of 250 degrees C. Thermal constraints from the thermal springs at Grimsel Pass suggest bulk fault permeabilities in the range of 2e-15 m(2)-4.8e-15 m(2). Reported residence times of >30,000 and 7 years for the deep geothermal and shallow groundwater components in the thermal spring water, respectively, suggest fault permeabilities of around 2.5e-15 m(2). We show that the long residence time of the deep geothermal water is likely a consequence of low recharge rates during the last glaciation event in the Swiss Alps, which started some 30,000 years ago. Deep groundwater discharging at Grimsel Pass today thus infiltrated the Grimsel fault prior to the last glaciation event. The range of permeabilities estimated from observational constraints is fully consistent with a subcritical single-pass flow system in the fault plane. Plain Language Summary Observations from warm springs discharging through a fault at Grimsel Pass (2,164 m.a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps are used to constrain a numerical model of the deep water circulation feeding the springs. The springs are known to have been active for at least 3.3 million years and to be due to ascent of meteoric water that penetrated to depths exceeding 10 km, where it acquired temperatures above 250 degrees C. Simulations show that the circulation along the fault connects a meteoric recharge zone at high altitude to the west with a sub-vertical permeable discharge zone at Grimsel Pass. A key unknown is the permeability of the fault. Temperature, discharge rate and chemical composition of the spring water depend on flow conditions at depth and can be used to estimate the fault's bulk permeability. Our study shows that the range of fault permeabilities can be narrowed down to roughly half an order of magnitude: 1e-15 m(2)-5e-15 m(2). This permeability range is consistent with a currently stable, single-pass flow pattern. Long water-residence times inferred from the isotopic composition of the spring water suggest low recharge rates during the last glaciation and the dominance of a multi-pass flow pattern during that time.

Thermal waters of Kuril Islands were found to exhibit four main isotopic shifts relative to the local meteoric water line. The ultra-acid Cl-SO4 (SO4-Cl) waters show a mixing trend between the meteoric component and volcanic steam. Acid steam-heated SO4 waters demonstrate trends indicating kinetic fractionation at temperatures near the boiling point. The isotope compositions for coastal springs plot at the line of mixing between meteoric and sea water. The oxygen isotope shift for the thermal waters that from geothermal wells is formed by isotope exchange with the host rock. The latitude effect detected in the isotope composition of meteoric water is also seen to varying degrees in the isotope composition of thermal water.	[Kalacheva, E. G.; Taran, Yu.

The fluid is assumed to be in chemical equilibrium with anhydrite and chalcedony in the aquifer, and mixed with diluted waters during its ascent. An attempt has been made to establish a relationship between reservoir temperature, the aqueous sulfate and silica contents of the mixed fluid, the proportion of the thermal end-member and the temperature of the, adiabatic mixture. The method calculates mineral solubilities in the field context, calibrated on representative thermal springs. The method also considers the effects of conductive cooling. (c) 2006 CNR.

There are some Naegleria spp. that can cause fatal infections in animals and humans, and the most important source of infection is through direct water contact. In this study, a real-time quantitative PCR was developed to detect and quantify the Naegleria spp. in various environmental water samples. The water samples were taken from rivershed, water treatment plants, and thermal spring recreation areas. The total detection rate was 4.0 % (7/176) for Naegleria spp. The percentages of samples containing Naegleria spp. from river water, raw drinking water, and thermal spring water were 0 % (0/100), 10.7 % (3/28) and 8.3 % (4/48), respectively. The concentration of Naegleria spp. in detected positive raw drinking water and thermal spring water samples was in the range of 3.9-12.6 and 1.1-24.2 cells/L, respectively. The identified species included Naegleria australiensis, Naegleria lovaniensis, and Naegleria spitzbergeniensis. The presence of Naegleria spp. in various aquatic environments is considered a potential public health threat.

The thermal spring is considered as source of non-conventional energy. The advantage of this energy source over other is that it is perennial, inexhaustible and pollution free. Researches for using this energy have been undertaken over decades. In fact reserve of minerals and fossil fuels are non-renewable and continuously diminishing in quantity. The day has been approaching-perhaps by the turn of the century-when the fuel energy is bound to confront the development of the nation. Man has been looking for harnessing other sources of energy. Geothermal source is catching the imagination of all because of least cost to the environment. The geothermal energy has been utilized for various purposes throughout the world. In India electricity is generated by utilizing geothermal energy at Manikaran. The low enthalpy geothermal energy resource has been utilized for various purposes other than generating electricity. The thermal springs of Odisha are categorized as low enthalpy type. Low temperature, low total dissolved solids (TDS) and low outflow of thermal springs of Odisha suggest various uses other than electricity generation. The utilization of hot water of the springs would be in hydrotherapy, specially for the treatment of rheumatic and arthritic conditions. People sometimes drink this water for the treatment of gout, gastric disorder, dyspepsia and high blood pressure etc. As the water contains some sulphur it would be useful for treatment of skin diseases such as acne, eczema etc. The medicinal value of these waters has been enhanced by the presence of radon content. The water in some cases is clean enough to be potable. The water is used for drinking and cooking purposes. Health resorts (spa) have been constructed near thermal springs. In the field of agriculture, space heating, food processing, geothermal energy has played a significant role. Considerable quantity of helium gas in the thermal springs would be utilized in nuclear and space research.											9	0	0	0	6	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							91	100		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_8	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		10	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400009

These adits are "Krystyna" and "318," and the springs are Maria and Mniszek, which are situated in the Upper Silesian Region (sothern Poland). The results that were obtained permitted us to infer that acid drainage can occur within the pits. Thus, the waters of the adits are acid and typified by a high concentration of sulphates and iron ions. A distinguishing feature of the "318" adit is its high thermal stability. The variation in temperature during the year does not exceed 1 degrees C. The springs flow from Carbon sandstone and therefore, they functioned as reference samples for the adits that were investigated. A high synchronicity of changes in the selected physical-chemical parameters of adit waters and natural springs was observed.

Many of the larger ones issue from the Carboniferous limestone that occurs in over 40% of the country. The spring water is mainly a calcium bicarbonate type with a temperature of about 10 degrees C. In the 18th century, warm and cold springs were developed as spas in various parts of Ireland. The popularity of these springs was short and most were in major decline by 1850. Today only one cold spa at Lisdoonvarna, Co. Glare is still operating. Springs in Ireland were places of religious significance for the pre-Christian Druidic religion. In the Christian period they became holy wells, under the patronage of various saints. Cures for many different ailments were attributed to water from these wells.

The temperature and chemical composition of thermal water observed since the 1977-1978 eruption are found to have changed after the eruptions. The groundwater levels in the hot spring wells, observed before the 2000 eruption, are found to have changed approximately six months before the eruption. Changes of groundwater level, which reflect pore water pressure, are generally faster than those of the temperature and chemical composition of thermal water attributed to fluid flow. However, thermal water flow during the 2000 eruption of Usu volcano was probably triggered as fast as propagation. Because the thermal water at Toyako Onsen is affected by the eruptive activities of Usu volcano, understanding the relationship between volcanic activity of Usu volcano and changes in temperature, chemical composition and groundwater levels of the thermal water is useful for inferring volcanic eruption and activity of Usu volcano.

The Damavand thermal waters are characterized by outlet temperature values of 23 to 65 degrees C and the Ca-Cl or Ca-SO4 water types. Stable isotope values of 49 monthly precipitation samples from 5 stations at 2500 to 3200 m elevations were also measured in the study area and Damavand meteoric water line (DMWL) was drawn as delta D = 7.64 x delta O-18 + 8.93 (R-2 = 0.98, n = 49). It has a lower slope and intercept than the global meteoric water line (GMWL) due to isotope kinetic fractionation effects during precipitation. The delta O-18 = (-0.0018 x H-(m.a.s.l) -3.12) equation was derived based on precipitation data. The reservoir temperature was estimated to be 110-135 degrees C based on different geothermometers. Damavand volcano can be considered as the main heat source for the thermal springs in the region. The conductive process along with the mixing of thermal waters with shallow cold groundwaters is the main cooling mechanisms. Almost, all the thermal waters fall near the LMWL and within prediction interval area, indicating meteoric origin and no significant effect of water-rock interaction. The Damavand geothermal reservoir is fed by local meteoric water from altitudes of 2500 to 4100 m and circulates at least 500 m deep, near the magma chamber. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Deep groundwater recharge mechanism in the sedimentary and crystalline terrains of Sri Lanka: A study based on environmental isotope and chemical signatures	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Deep groundwater; Sedimentary terrain; Crystalline terrain; Artesian aquifers; Meteoric origin	WATER; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; BASIN; FLUORIDE; AQUIFER	Springs discharge groundwater that travels along flow paths of different spatial and time domains. In many instances, it is difficult to describe its involved groundwater movement, availability as well as geochemical evolution due to its hidden nature. The present study has assessed the deep groundwater in the form of thermal and non-thermal springs in the Palavi and Vanathavillu basins of sedimentary terrain as well as the Southern, Eastern, and Eastern-North Central lowlands of the crystalline terrain of Sri Lanka, using isotope and geochemical approaches. The results revealed that cation exchange in the sedimentary aquifers, whereas rock water interaction in hard rock and fairly deep aquifers, are the important factors that control the groundwater chemistry. Artesian wells in the sedimentary terrain are mainly recharged by meteoric water, moving through fractured basement rocks at elevations from 100 to 200m above sea level, and have a long residence time. Despite its proximity to the West coast, the data acquired do not indicate that there is seawater mixing. Mixing of percolated water through an unconsolidated geological matrix appears to promote an increase in the salinity of groundwater. Non-mixed, non-evaporated, and young groundwater with a recharge elevation of more than 1000 m above mean sea level can be found in the Southern lowlands of the crystalline terrain. In the Eastern North Central lowlands, groundwater is lowland originated, fast replanished and significantly mixed with evaporated surface water. Thermal waters do not contain tritium and therefore are older than 50 years and have deeply percolated. Artesian water in the Eastern region is high altitude originated and intensely rock-water interacted. Some hot springs in the same area emerging through weathered overburden have water significantly mixed with recent precipitation. Thermal springs that emerge through quartzite bedrock have a non mixed, non-evaporated, and less rock-water interacted nature. Both thermal and non-thermal water with artesian conditions have clearly indicated that they originate from a common recharge source but with different flow paths, penetration depths, and travel distances, resulting in different chemical characteristics. Non-thermal springs are recharged by recent precipitation and have percolated only to shallow depths.	[Priyadarshanee, K. S. G. S.; Edirisinghe, E. A. N. V.; Gunasekara, J. D.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Geochemistry and conceptual model of thermal waters from Ercis - Zilan Valley, Eastern Turkey	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Thermal springs; Advective flow; Hydrogeochemistry; Conceptual model; Van; Eastern anatolia geothermal province	CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; MINERALIZED WATERS; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; GEOTHERMOMETRY; NEOTECTONICS; TECTONICS; EVOLUTION; VOLCANISM; ANATOLIA; PLATEAU	Faults related to the neotectonic stress regime of Eastern Anatolia permit the rise and outflow of thermal waters in the Zilan Valley located 30 km north of the Ercis, Van province. Thermal springs discharge in a volcanic terrain, often in clusters, along faults in two separate areas: In the vicinity of Taskapi (orkiiy) and Gergili villages, which lie in the north of the area; and in the area of Hasanabdal (Doganci) thermal springs that lie to the south of the Zilan Valley. Temperatures of the springs range from 20 to 78 degrees C, with discharge rates of 4 - 20 L/s. Thermal waters of the Zilan region are of different types, from Na - HCO3 to Na-Cl, with dissolved ion concentrations varying over a wide range between 484-4572 mg/L. Calcite dissolution and silicate hydrolysis are the dominant water-rock interactions. Constituents with minor and trace element concentrations reinforce conclusions drawn from major-ion composition that the major hydrogeochemical processes are: mixing between cold-shallow and hot-deep waters, loss of energy by heat conduction, and swam-heating of perched-aquifers. The cold spring and Zilan Creek waters are of the Ca - HCO3 and Na - HCO3 type respectively, and their dissolved ion concentrations are low. Hydrogeochemical processes for the cold waters involve carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering reactions. Chemical geothermometers are used to estimate the temperature of the deep fluids using the chemical composition of the less modified fluids. They indicate that fluids emerging from volcanic rocks in the Zilan valley reach temperatures of around 150 degrees C. Thermal waters, generated through conducive heat transfer or the input of geothermal vapor or gases from below, delineate the extent of the geothermal reservoir(s) at depth. Deuterium and oxygen-18 signatures of thermal waters indicate that they are at least partially derived from thermally heated water through a process of O-18 enrichment owing to interaction with the marine limestones through which the water passes to the surface springs. Both geochemical and isotope data indicate that the Zilan Valley hosts a low temperature, fracture-zone system with aconvective up-flow and dominant conducive heat transfer from a resource base in the upper crust to the surface. Ore deposits in the Zilan Valley, hydrothermal alteration in the Sorkoy lava, and high concentrations of As, Au, Hg, Zr, Ba, Ni, Sb and other trace elements that are present in the travertine is the evidence for a heat source formed at a shallower depth. A conceptual model of the geothermal system of Zilan is proposed based on adata gathered.

The spatial limitation of hot springs, coupled with extreme attractiveness to humans for recreation and commercial exploitation, means they are especially vulnerable to degradation and biodiversity loss. The aquatic community is often poorly studied or ignored, but their inclusion in any study of aquatic biodiversity of a region is vital. In this study.. live and preserved samples of periphytic mats from natural and artificial substrates, muds, and water from different thermal springs in Colombia were examined to characterize the taxonomy and ecological habitat of the constituent algae. Some mats were cultivated on solid Bristol and complex thermomineral media to isolate specimens for taxonomical characterization. In addition, some ethanolic and hydrolytic extracts of mats and muds were used to evaluate its potential antibiotic production.

This density increase generates forced convection and subsequent movement of cold water along the underwater slope to maximum depths. Cooling of deep and near-bottom waters caused by forced convection is compensated during other seasons of the year by eddy heat flux directed toward the bottom.

Multi proxy approach to evaluate and delineate the potential of hot springs in the Kotli District (Kashmir, Pakistan)	GEOLOGICA ACTA			English	Article						Hot springs; Radon survey; Hydro-geochemistry; Geo-thermometry; Isotope composition; Geothermal system	GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; RADON; GEOCHEMISTRY; WATERS; AREAS; TEMPERATURES	Tattapani hot springs are located near the Kotli District of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. This study evaluates these hot springs based on surface geological information, radon emission measurements, hydro-geochemical and isotopic signatures and potential source mechanisms. Field observations reveal that the hot springs are located at the crest of the Tattapani anticline along the faulted contact of Cambrian carbonates with Paleocene siliciclastics. In addition, remnants of igneous intrusions in the Cambrian carbonates are commonly observed. Spatial distribution of radon emissions (ranging between 2.1 and 29.5KBq m(-3)) indicates an anomalous zone located over the Cambrian-Paleocene faulted contact. Hydro-geochemical data show sodium-bicarbonate affinity of hot springs. The highest surface temperature of these springs is recorded at 60.8 degrees C. Average reservoir temperatures based on silica and cation geo-thermometers are 101 degrees C and 115 degrees C, respectively. Giggenbach ternary diagram (Na-KMg) suggests a non-equilibrium state between fluid and rock, whereas isotopic and chemical data indicate heat loss by conductive cooling and mixing with groundwater during the flow of thermal water up to the surface. Oxygen and deuterium isotopes indicate that thermal water is of meteoric origin, rain and/or snow in the north at higher altitudes providing the potential recharge. Furthermore, absence of tritium in the thermal water suggests a residence time of more than 50 years.	[Anees, M.; Shah, M.

Latitude, altitude, and continent effects have significant bearing on the values of delta D and delta O-18 of the hot water samples. Oxygen-18 shift is not significant in most of the thermal groundwater, especially the hot water of low-to-moderate temperature. Slight oxygen-18 shift is only found in some hot springs of high temperature in Tibet and western Yunnan and in thermal groundwater of low-to-moderate temperature in the deep-seated carbonate aquifers in the northern North China Plain (including the Tianjin area). Near-surface boiling may causes the shift of the former and the latter may be attributed to exchange of oxygen-18 between water and carbonates in the geothermal systems of taphrogenic basin-type. Hot springs in Tibet and western Sichuan have very low contents of delta D and delta O-18, possibly due to recharge of precipitation and snow-melting water of extremely depleted delta D and delta O-18 values at high latitudes of several thousands of meters.

The springs are divided into two main groups based on temperature, host rock, total dissolved solids (TDS), and major and minor elements. TDS, electrical conductivity (EC), Cl-, and SO42 concentrations of hot springs are all higher than in cold springs. Higher TDS in hot springs probably reflect longer circulation and residence time. The high Si, B, and Sr contents in thermal waters are probably the result of extended water-rock interaction and reflect flow paths and residence time. Binary, ternary, and Giggenbach diagrams were used to understand the deeper mixing conditions and locations of springs in the model system. It is believed that the springs are heated either by mixing of deep geothermal fluid with cold groundwater or low conductive heat flow. Mixing ratios are evaluated using Cl, Na, and B concentrations and a mass balance approach. Calculated quartz and chalcedony geothermometer give lower reservoir temperatures than cation geothermometers. The silica-enthalpy mixing model predicts a subsurface reservoir temperature between 62 and 90 degrees C.

In order to understand the characteristic and origin of the geothermal fluid related to the Slamet volcanic system emphasizing the identification of formation water influx represented by sea water signature in the thermal fluid, the water chemistry has been analyzed including stable isotopes of the hot springs, cold springs, shallow groundwater, rainwater, and river water surrounding the Slamet Volcano. The temperature of manifestations is in the range of 42 - 72 degrees C, while the chloride concentration of the geothermal water is ranging from 17 to 754 mg/L. Specifically, the manifestations in Baturaden are distinctively featured by a huge travertine deposit. The values of Cl/B ratio and non-equilibrium state of the reactive elements indicate the existence of two main geothermal fluid flows discharging as hot springs at Baturaden, Paguyangan, and Guci complexes. Guci hot spring complex shows a similar characteristic as fumarole condensate water from the summit of Slamet Volcano which has been diluted by meteoric water. On the other hand, Baturaden hot spring complex appears to be affected not only by fumarole condensate, but also by the contribution of formation water from marine sedimentary rock. Meanwhile, Paguyangan hot spring is more likely as the outflow of a geothermal reservoir which has also been interacting with marine sedimentary rock. Furthermore, the signature of stable isotope of delta O-18 and delta H-2 shows a significant portion of meteoric water contributing in the dilution of thermal waters.

Design of these clay-based formulations continues to be a field scarcely addressed. Safety and wound healing properties of different fibrous nanoclay/spring water hydrogels were addressed. Methods: in vitro biocompatibility, by means of MTT assay, and wound healing properties were studied. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy was used to study the morphology of fibroblasts during the wound healing process. Results: all the ingredients demonstrated to be biocompatible towards fibroblasts. Particularly, the formulation of nanoclays as hydrogels improved biocompatibility with respect to powder samples at the same concentration. Spring waters and hydrogels were even able to promote in vitro fibroblasts motility and, therefore, accelerate wound healing with respect to the control. Conclusion: fibrous nanoclay/spring water hydrogels proved to be skin-biocompatible and to possess a high potential as wound healing formulations. Moreover, these results open new prospects for these ingredients to be used in new therapeutic or cosmetic formulations.

Assessment of Groundwater Quality of Diyadin Springs, East Part of Turkey for Human Consumption	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Thermal activity; Thermomineral spring; Ionic activity coefficient		Hydrogeological investigation were carried out to assess groundwater quality of Diyadin springs area for its suitability for human consumption, especially thermal activities. The research area consist of Paleozoic aged quartzschist, marble and diorite, Mesozoic aged ophiolitic melange, Cenozoic aged volcano-sedimentary series and alluvium, travertine and terrace conglomerate. Physical and chemical parameters of springs such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO22-, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl- were determined. The concentrations of a large number of inorganic chemicals in groundwater for example Fe2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cr3+, F-, B3+ were also measured. Interpretation of analytical data shows that Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- are the dominant water types in the research area. Ni2+, Cr3+, Co2+ and Al2+ are absent and the other inorganic chemicals are within the permissible limits for human consumption and these spring waters are good for thermal activities.

Turnover time of Tural and Rajvadi hot spring waters, Maharashtra, India	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Hot springs; radiocarbon dating; turnover time; water sampling	DECCAN TRAPS; ISOTOPE; KOYNA	Sixty hot springs are spread over 18 regions in the west coast of Maharashtra, India. The area is covered by Deccan Basalts. Periodic water sampling was done for more than 5 years from Tural and Rajvadi hot springs along with waters from other deep wells for hydrochemical and isotopic analyses to study the relation between seismicity and hydrochemistry. Residence time of hot spring waters was estimated using the C-14 dating. Though the studied hot springs are located in an active seismic region, their hydrochemical, isotopic and temperature signatures did not indicate any major change during the period of the experiment. A comparison with the data collected by GSI three and a half decades ago indicates no long-term change in the hydrochemistry and temperature. Lack of long-term change in hydrochemistry reveals no major effect of seismicity on these geothermal waters. Radiocarbon dating of these two hot spring waters indicates relatively more turnover time for Tural spring (3080 +/- 40 years BP) than the Rajvadi (1720 +/- 45 years BP). The trace element characteristics of the spring waters are close to those measured on waters of granitic terrains, thus indicating the circulation of meteoric water through the granitic basement, before its discharge in the form of thermal springs in the Deccan Trap terrain.

The temperature, specific electrical conductivity and pH values of the thermal waters are, respectively, 21.6-29.4 degrees C, 4020-57,200 mu S/cm and 6.85-7.35. Thermal waters are Na-Cl-type brackish to saline waters. The Golbasi geothermal system is fed by meteoric waters and local seawater. The waters are heated at depth by high geothermal gradient caused by the recent tectonic activity in the deep and ascend to the surface through fractures and faults by convection and emerge as thermal springs. The thermal waters mix in different proportions with seawater (5-58 %) and fresh cold waters during the moving up to the surface. Isotope data (delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium) show that the thermal waters are of meteoric origin, and the residence time at the reservoir is at least 50 years. Almost all the waters are saturated with respect to Ca-montmorillonite, gibbsite, K-mica, illite, kaolinite, Fe (OH)(3)(a), calcite, dolomite and barite minerals. The most expected minerals that cause scaling at outlet conditions during the production and utilization of Golbasi geothermal waters are calcite, dolomite and some barite. Various chemical geothermometers, Na-K-Mg ternary diagram and mineral equilibrium diagrams suggest that the reservoir temperature is around 50-100 degrees C.

Deep groundwater circulation and associated methane leakage in the northern Canadian Rocky Mountains	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Shale gas; Thermal spring; Methane leakage	THERMAL SPRINGS; HEAT-FLOW; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; WATER; GEOTHERMOMETER; CRUST	Concern over potential impact of shale gas development on shallow groundwater systems requires greater understanding of crustal scale fluid movement. We examined natural deeply circulating groundwater systems in northeastern British Columbia adjacent to a region of shale gas development, in order to elucidate origin of waters, depths of circulation, and controls on fluid flow. These systems are expressed as thermal springs that occur in the deformed sedimentary rocks of the Liard Basin. Stable isotope data from these springs show that they originate as meteoric water. Although there are no thermal anomalies in the region, outlet temperatures range from 30 to 56 degrees C, reflecting depth of circulation. Based on aqueous geothermometry and geothermal gradients, circulation depths up to 3.8 km are estimated, demonstrating connection of deep groundwater systems to the surface. Springs are also characterised by leakage of thermogenic gas from deep strata that is partly attenuated by methanotrophic microbial communities in the spring waters. Springs are restricted to anomalous structural features, cross cutting faults, and crests of fault-cored anticlines. On a regional scale they are aligned with the major tectonic features of the Liard Line and Larsen Fault. This suggests that while connection of surface to deep reservoirs is possible, it is rare and restricted to highly deformed geologic units that produce permeable pathways from depth through otherwise thick intervening shale units. Results allow a better understanding of potential for communication between deep shale gas units and shallow aquifer systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Springs were placed vertical and parallel to the plate to create turbulence in the flow. Al2O3/water and CuO/water nanofluids were produced using the two-step method with three nanoparticle weight fractions (0.1%, 0.5% and 1%). Within the ranges studied, the Al2O3-water nanofluid provides maximum improvement in heat transfer coefficient of about 76.1% in the parallel spring plate heat exchanger compared to the base fluid. For the same mass ratio and spring arrangement, this increase rate is 69.9% in the CuO-water nanofluid. The highest performance factor was determined when Al2O3-water nanofluid was used in the spring arrangement, whose springs were placed parallel to the channel at a flow rate of 5.5 lt/min, and this value was found to be 1.51.

This work focuses on geochemical and isotopic analysis of the thermal waters and their hydrological implications. We found a system with partially equilibrated waters with dominant Cl- Na+ and subordinated HCO3-Ca2+ (Mg2+) and SO(4)(2-)Ca(2+ )compositions, which seem affected to the basin fill composed of thick Cenozoic synorogenic deposits overlying early Paleozoic carbonate successions. Several cationic geothermometers suggest a deep reservoir with average temperatures reaching similar to 170 degrees C, while the silica geothermometers suggest a shallow reservoir at 91 degrees C. The average temperature of the springs is 28 degrees C and the low-geothermal gradients (similar to 27 degrees C/km) in the region indicate a relatively deeper (similar to 5500 m) reservoir and another shallower (similar to 2500 m). The source of heat is related to the orogenic belt because this region is on top of the flat-slab subduction of the South-Central Andes, with an absence of active volcanism. Hence, this spring system is mainly affected by the relatively low-geothermal gradient within the Eastern Precordillera. The geochemical and isotopic characteristics O-18/O-16 as well as H-2/H-1 ratios of waters indicate meteoric source associated with evaporation in relation to strong aridity and secondary processes modifying the chemistry of waters is likely to be erased by any thermal end-member signature. Our conceptual model for the LLSS indicates the N-S trending Villicum-Zonda regional thrust and the minor accommodation faults within the Eastern Precordillera domain seem to behave as the preferential zone for recharging and latter thermal water rising.

The main hydrochemical type of hot spring water samples is HCO3-Na+. The delta H-2 values range from -157.6 parts per thousand to -123.4 parts per thousand and delta O-18 values range from -24.5 parts per thousand to -15.4 parts per thousand. The hot spring water in the Litang fault zone is mainly recharged by infiltrating precipitation, with a recharge elevation of 4062-6018 m. Hydrochemical types of Litang hot springs are mainly controlled by the circulation of groundwater in a deep fault system, and are related to the rock lithology of thermal reservoir and water-rock reaction areas. Hot springs in the Litang fault zone attribute to three different heat sources, belonging to three geothermal systems. The flow direction of groundwater in the LFZ is roughly from northwest to southeast along the Litang fault. The deeper the circulation depth of hot spring water on the fault, the higher the thermal reservoir temperature and the stronger the seismic activity of the segment, which is closely related to the increase in pore fluid pressure, rock weakening, and deep fluid upwelling. This study is helpful for further study on regional hydrogeological environments and provides a scientific basis for revealing geothermal fluid movement in fault zones.

Sixteen hydrothermal locations were sampled in New Mexico and the water analyzed for chemical and microbial composition. As a result of these analysis it is concluded that hot springs in the Valles Caldera area are heated by a shallow magma chamber, while all other sampled hot springs appear to be associated with the Rio Grande Rift. The hypothesis is put forward that prominent fracture zones associated with the Rio Grande Rift provide the discharge area of a deep (upper crustal) regional ground-water flow system.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			The Seben-Kesenozu low-temperature geothermal prospect, NW Turkey: study of an advective geothermal system	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Thermal springs; Advective flow; Low-temperature fracture zone system; Geochemistry; Heating potential; Turkey	WATERS	The Kesenozu thermal springs are located in northwestern Turkey, about 10 km south of Seben. The springs emerge from a fracture zone created by strike-slip faulting that strikes north-northwest, along the Hamambogazi Creek, in northwestern Anatolia. The reservoir comprises a steeply dipping fracture zone and deep, feeding aquifers hosted by limestones and conglomerates of the Kesenozu Formation. Eight springs and one shallow well discharge thermal water at a total rate of about 44 l/s with temperatures between 42 and 78 degrees C. The waters are of neutral pH, NaHCO3 type. The meteoric origin of the spa waters is evident from their chemical and isotopic (O-18, H-2, H-3) compositions. The thermal system is driven by deepreaching advective flows where rainwater becomes heated on descent, and after deep paths ascend along fractures that act as hydrothermal conduits. It can be described as an advective geothermal system. Silica (chalcedony) geothermometry indicates equilibrium temperatures between 89 and 94 degrees C. A recently drilled deep well encountered similar temperatures at about 2 km depth. The minimum heating power potential (direct use) of the fracture zone reservoir is about 10 MWth.

However, its therapeutic effects on different types of cancer including breast cancer (BC) have not been reported so far. In this study, we analyzed the characterization of nanoparticles presented in MCs of thermal spring water in Rabor County, Kerman Province, Iran. We conducted the present study using X-ray fluorescence spectra, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, X-ray powder diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy methods. We compared the oxidative evaluation of MCs with the control group using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl test Also, the anti-cancer influences of MCs against BC cell lines (MCF-7) were assessed and compared with the human fibroblast cells (hFCs) using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test Finally, we investigated the impact of MCs on the liver and kidney tissues of normal rats. Results of this study confirmed the presence of various oxides, including SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO, as well as elements, such as Sr, V, and Cr, in MCs. Moreover, our results showed that with an increase in the concentration of used MCs, the cell survival of cancer cell lines significantly decreased compared to hFCs. Also, no histologic change was observed in normal tissues exposed to MCs; however, MCs that existed in thermal spring water showed a considerable anti-cancer effect against BC cell lines.

We used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to investigate microbial communities sampled from four pH 4 thermal springs collected from four regions of YNP that differed in their fluid temperature and geochemistry. Our results revealed that the composition of bacterial communities varied among the sites, despite sharing similar pH values. The taxonomic composition and metabolic functional potential of the site with the lowest temperature (55 A degrees C), a thermal spring from the Seven Mile Hole (SMH) area, were further investigated using shotgun metagenome sequencing. The taxonomic classification, based on 372 Mbp of unassembled metagenomic reads, indicated that this community included a high proportion of Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Functional comparison with other YNP thermal spring metagenomes indicated that the SMH metagenome was enriched in genes related to energy production and conversion, transcription, and carbohydrate transport. Analysis of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism revealed assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways, whereas the majority of genes involved in sulfur metabolism were related to the reduction of sulfate to adenylylsulfate, sulfite, and H2S. Given that pH 4 thermal springs are relatively less common in YNP and thermal areas worldwide, they may harbor novel microbiota and the communities that inhabit them deserve further investigation.

J	Pandarinath, K				Pandarinath, Kailasa			Solute geothermometry of springs and wells of the Los Azufres and Las Tres Virgenes geothermal fields, Mexico	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						solute geothermometers; Mexican thermal springs; Mexican geothermal fluids; discordant outliers; Los Azufres geothermal field; Las Tres Virgenes geothermal field	STATIC FORMATION TEMPERATURES; DISCORDANCY TEST VARIANTS; GEOCHEMICAL REFERENCE MATERIALS; BAJA-CALIFORNIA; CRITICAL-VALUES; NORMAL SAMPLES; THERMAL SPRINGS; HUMEROS CALDERA; STATISTICAL EVALUATION; REGRESSION-MODELS	Subsurface reservoir temperatures of two important Mexican geothermal systems (Los Azufres and Las Tres Virgenes) were estimated by applying all available solute geothermometers for 88 and 56 chemical data measurements of the spring waters and fluids of the deep geothermal wells, respectively. Most of the chemical data for spring water of these two geothermal fields are for HCO3 water, followed by SO4 and Cl types. For the Los Azufres geothermal field (LAGF), the reservoir temperatures estimated by Na-K geothermometers for springs of HCO3 and SO4 waters, and by Na-Li and Li-Mg geothermometers for Cl water, are close to the average bottom-hole temperature (BHT) of the geothermal wells. However, all reservoir temperatures for spring waters from the Las Tres Virgenes geothermal field (LTVGF) estimated by all solute geothermometers indicated significantly large differences (low temperatures) compared to the BHT. Evaluation of inferred reservoir temperatures for spring waters of the LAGF and LTVGF suggests that not all springs nor all solute geothermometers provide reliable estimation of the reservoir temperatures. Even though chemical equilibrium probably was not achieved in the water-rock system, Na-K geothermometers for HCO3 water (peripheral water mainly of meteoric origin with little geothermal component) and SO4 water (geothermal steam heated) and Na-Li and Li-Mg geothermometers for Cl-rich spring water (fully mature geothermal water) of the LAGF indicated reservoir temperatures close to the BHT. However, in comparison with the geothermometry of spring water of the LAGF and LTVGF, fluid measurements from geothermal wells of these two fields indicated reservoir temperatures in close agreement with their respective BHTs. For the best use of the solute geothermometry for spring water, it is advisable to: (1) chemically classify the springs based on water types; (2) identify and eliminate the discordant outlier observations by considering each water type as a separate sampled population; (3) apply all available solute geothermometers employing a suitable computer program such as SolGeo instead of using some specific, arbitrarily chosen geothermometers; and (4) evaluate the temperatures obtained for each solute geothermometer by considering the subsurface lithology, hydrological conditions, and BHTs or static formation temperatures whenever available.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Hydrogeochemical study of the thermal and mineralized waters of the Banaz (Hamambogazi) area, western Anatolia, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hamambogazi thermal spring; Hydrogeochemistry; Stable isotope; Banaz; Turkey	CHEMISTRY	The Hamambogazi spa in western Turkey was built around natural hot springs with discharge temperatures in the range of 30-54A degrees C; the waters have near neutral pH values of 6.50-7.10 and a TDS content between 2,694 and 2,982 mg/l. Thermal water with a temperature of 47.5-73A degrees C has been produced at 325 l/s from five wells since 1994, causing some springs to go dry. A management plan is required in the study area to maximize the benefits of this resource, for which currently proposed direct uses include heating in the district and greenhouses, as well as balneology in new spas in the area. The best use for the water from each spring or well will depend on its temperature, chemistry and location. The thermal waters are mixed Na-Mg-HCO3-SO4 fluids that contain a significant amount of CO2 gas. The chemical geothermometers applied to the Hamambogazi thermal waters yield a maximum reservoir temperature of 130A degrees C. Isotope results (O-18, H-2, H-3) indicate that the thermal waters have a meteoric origin: rainwater percolates downward along fractures and faults, is heated at depth, and then rises to the surface along fractures and faults that act as a hydrothermal conduit. The basement around the Banaz Hamambogazi resort is comprised of Paleozoic metamorphic schist and marbles exposed 8 km south and 15 km north of Banaz. Mesozoic marble, limestone and ophiolitic complex are observed a few km west and in the northern part of Banaz. These units were cut at a depth of 350-480 m in boreholes drilled in the area. Overlying lacustrine deposits are composed of fine clastic units that alternate with gypsum, tuff and tuffites of 200-350 m thickness. The marble and limestones form the thermal water aquifer, while lacustrine deposits form the impermeable cap.

This region is famous for its balneotherapy and health tourism attractions. They are located in the transitional zone between the Sanandaj-Sirjan (mainly metamorphosed zone) and the Orumieh-Dokhtar (mainly volcanic zone) structural zones. The host rocks of the region include sedimentary to volcanic rocks (Permian to Quaternary), but Quaternary-aged alluvium and travertine layers are the main outcrops. Additionally, these features reveal that thermal and shallow ground waters had been mixed before hot springs exposure. The chemistry data show that these waters are enriched in Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, HCO3-, and SO42- as well as U and NO3-. The chemistry of thermal and shallow groundwater samples are graphed in the Cl--SO42--HCO3- ternary and other diagrams. In addition, hot springs having high NO3--concentrations indicate that thermal waters mix with shallow groundwater, which are attributed to agricultural and other anthropogenic activities. The hot springs have high U concentration that may result in shallow groundwater mixing with andesitic tuff, granodiorite, shale, and schist of the region. Therefore, the local farms and agricultural crops as well as local residents' health could be at risk of exposure to the U and NO3- pollution.

J	Shatwell, T; Adrian, R; Kirillin, G				Shatwell, Tom; Adrian, Rita; Kirillin, Georgiy			Planktonic events may cause polymictic-dimictic regime shifts in temperate lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LONG-TERM; THERMAL STRUCTURE; WATER TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEG-MODEL; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; LIGHT; MECHANISMS	Water transparency affects the thermal structure of lakes, and within certain lake depth ranges, it can determine whether a lake mixes regularly (polymictic regime) or stratifies continuously (dimictic regime) from spring through summer. Phytoplankton biomass can influence transparency but the effect of its seasonal pattern on stratification is unknown. Therefore we analysed long term field data from two lakes of similar depth, transparency and climate but one polymictic and one dimictic, and simulated a conceptual lake with a hydrodynamic model. Transparency in the study lakes was typically low during spring and summer blooms and high in between during the clear water phase (CWP), caused when zooplankton graze the spring bloom. The effect of variability of transparency on thermal structure was stronger at intermediate transparency and stronger during a critical window in spring when the rate of lake warming is highest. Whereas the spring bloom strengthened stratification in spring, the CWP weakened it in summer. The presence or absence of the CWP influenced stratification duration and under some conditions determined the mixing regime. Therefore seasonal plankton dynamics, including biotic interactions that suppress the CWP, can influence lake temperatures, stratification duration, and potentially also the mixing regime.

The satellite information combined with summertime beach closure data at Ontario Beach, Rochester, NY, shows that there is a correlation of the percent of summer beach closings caused by accumulation of algae (primarily Cladophora) with the cumulative temperature contrast between nearshore and offshore waters during the spring heating period. The physical conditions created by a rapid warming of the nearshore water during the spring warming period appear to generate conditions favorable to Cladophora growth in the summer. The results of this study suggest that satellite thermal observations of Lake Ontario in the spring can be used to better understand year-to-year variability of Cladophora growth as well as potential reactions to climate change.

Such springs have meteoric isotopic signature and emerge, after very well developed convective circulation at depth, along important tectonic structures such as the Son-Narmada-Tapti rift zone and the West Coast Fault. Chemical components in both gas and liquid phases and geothermometric estimations suggest that such springs are not related to the presence of any active hydrothermal systems at shallow depth in any of the studied areas. The hottest convective water emerges at Tattapani at near boiling point for water at atmospheric pressure ( > 90 degrees C) in association with an N-2-rich gas phase of clear meteoric signature. Since such fluids do not carry any corrosive components, they could be conveniently exploited for industrial purposes, such as drying processes. From a tectonic point of view, the presence of thermal emergences scattered in a wide area along geologically well defined structures, which also generate frequent moderate earthquakes, suggests that such structures are active. Although the isotopic composition of thermal springs points to a meteoric origin, their feeding aquifers are not topographically driven as in most active Alpine orogenic belts. The relative high quantity of total helium in the associated gas phase suggests also that they are really deep, old, long circulating waters. We propose for such waters the term 'intracratonic thermal waters' since the isotopic signature of He in the gas phase does not show any release of primordial He-3 in any of the areas of spring emergence. Based on the quite low He-3/He-4 ratio in the gas phase we suggest also that, in spite of its morphological shape, the Narmada-Son-Tapti rift zone cutting the Indian subcontinent in two is more related to paleo-suture rather than to a mid-continental rift system.

Characteristic intervals of TB propagation velocities in reservoirs for different depths and bottom inclinations are found. It is demonstrated that the main factor that affects the TB lifetime is the reservoir depth. The influence of the relative air humidity and solar radiation flux on the spring TB propagation velocity is estimated. Isolines of spacetime variability of the TB location in the water area of the reservoir are constructed using the simulations and the quantitative parameters of Lake Ladoga bottom relief. Satisfactory agreement between the simulated data and the field observations is achieved.	[Blokhina, N.

J	Cruz, JV; Franca, Z				Cruz, JV; Franca, Z			Hydrogeochemistry of thermal and mineral water springs of the Azores archipelago (Portugal)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						volcanic rock aquifer; mineral water; thermal water; geochemistry; multivariate analysis; Azores	ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS; VOLCANO; GROUNDWATER; ISLAND; CHEMISTRY; GEOCHEMISTRY; DISCHARGES; SYSTEM; FLUXES	Mineral and thermal water chemistry from the Azores archipelago was investigated in order to discriminate among hydro-chemical facies and isotopic groups and identify the major geochemical processes that affect water composition. A systematic geochemical survey of mineral and thermal water chemistry was carried out, incorporating new data as well as results from the literature. The Azores are a volcanic archipelago consisting of nine islands and samples were collected at Sao Miguel, Graciosa, Faial, Sao Jorge, Pico and Flores islands. Hydrothermal manifestations show the effects of active volcanism on several islands. Discharges are mainly related to active Quaternary central volcanoes, of basaltic to trachytic composition, but also some springs are related to older dormant or extinct volcanoes. Multivariate analysis - principal component and cluster analysis - enables classification of water compositions into 4 groups and interpretation of processes affecting water compositions. Groups 1 and 2 discharge from perched-water bodies, and mostly correspond to Na-HCO3 and Na-HCO3-Cl type waters. These groups comprise of cold, thermal (27 degrees C-75 degrees C) and boiling waters (92.2 degrees C-93.2 degrees C), with a wide TDS range (77.3-27,145.7 mg/L). Group 3 is made of samples of dominated Na-SO4 from very acid boiling pools (pH range of 2.02-2.27) which are fed by steam-heated perched-water bodies. Group 4 is representative of springs from the basal aquifer system and corresponds to Na-Cl type fluids, with compositions dominated by seawater. Results are used to further develop a conceptual model characterizing the geochemical evolution of the studied waters. Mineral and thermal waters discharging from perched-water bodies are of meteoric origin and chemically evolve by absorption of magmatic volatiles (CO2) and by a limited degree of rock leaching. Existing data also suggest mixture between cold waters and thermal water. Water chemistry from springs that discharge from the basal aquifer system evolves by mixing with seawater; although, processes such as absorption of magmatic volatiles (CO2), rock leaching and mixture with hydrothermal waters are not excluded by the data because the actual composition of these waters deviates from that expected considering only conservative mixing between fresh and seawater.

J	Wildenschild, D; Roberts, JJ				Wildenschild, D; Roberts, JJ			Experimental tests of enhancement of vapor diffusion in Topopah Spring Tuff	JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA			English	Article							POROUS-MEDIA	The potential enhancement of thermally driven water vapor diffusion in Topopah Spring Tuff was investigated using a transient-state thermal conductivity measurement. Thermal conductivity was measured as a function of pressure, temperature, and water content by the method of Parikh et al. (1979), which allows separation of thermal conductivity from thermally induced Intent heat transport. The measured thermal conductivity of Topopah Spring Tuff ranged from 0.99 W/mK to 2.07 W/mK and showed an increase with increasing temperature above approximately 40 degreesC. These values are slightly lower than the range of values measured for other samples from the Yucca Mountain, Nevada site (e.g., Nimick, 1990). Enhancement of vapor diffusion in tuff was not observed at any of the investigated combinations of water contents, temperatures, and pressures. The method of Parikh et al. (1979) was subsequently tested on a mixture of quartz sand and 10% kaolinite. A considerable degree of enhancement was observed in the soil for a water saturation of 14%, demonstrating the capability of the method to estimate enhancement of vapor diffusion.

Here we conducted sampling in 30 thermal springs near fault zones in Fujian Province, and the major elements, trace elements, silica, stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) and strontium isotopes were tested in the laboratory. The results show that (1) the thermal springs in the study area can be divided into six types according to the content of the major elements: HCO3-Na, HCO3 center dot SO4-Na, Cl center dot HCO3-Na, Cl-Na, Cl-Na center dot Ca and HCO3 center dot SO4-Ca; (2) hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate that precipitation is the main source of recharge for thermal springs in the study area, and the recharge height is between 258 m and 1859 m; (3) the content of SiO2 in the thermal spring varies from 18.1 mg/L to 59.3 mg/L. The geothermal reservoir temperature calculated is 90~226 degrees C, and the circulation depth is 2.9~5.4 km, except for the W10 thermal spring, whose circulation depth is 8.4 km; and (4) the Sr-87/Sr-86 of the thermal springs in southwestern Fujian and eastern Fujian has obviously different characteristics, indicating the influence of different rock formations on the groundwater cycle process. Additionally, a continuous measurement of the main anions and cations was performed in five thermal springs every three days since January 2020. There were obvious abnormal changes in the hydrochemical compositions, chlorine in four of the five springs, sodium at three springs, and four ions at one spring, which all showed abnormal high-value changes by 15% to 80%, and which occurred 85~168 days prior to the M6.1 earthquake in Hualien, Taiwan. An inspiration could be provided for obtaining effective earthquake precursor anomalies by monitoring the change in ion concentration in thermal springs.

These springs are dispersed throughout the country and present in every major structural domain. However, a significant amount is concentrated in the northern and northeastern areas. Associated with the great hydrothermal system of eastern Morocco, the thermal spring of Goutitir emerges in the Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary formations located east of the Guercif Basin, composed of a mixture of clays, carbonates, and marls, covered in unconformity by Quaternary tabular molasses. The upflow of the thermal water is dependent of Alpine faults systems with N30 and N100 directions, which are probable reactivated Hercynian structures that facilitate its circulation to the surface. The Goutitir spring has been studied by an interdisciplinary approach to identify the origin of the thermal water, the rock-water interactions, and the reservoir temperatures, contributing to the establishment of the conceptual model of the associated hydrothermal system. This thermal water is of chloride-sodium type with a hyperthermal character (43-47 degrees C). The isotopic composition (delta O-18 = -8.7 to -8.35 parts per thousand; delta H-2 = -58.6 to -54.3 parts per thousand) indicates a meteoric origin and a recharging zone located at around 2000 m of altitude. The chemical composition allows to classify the water as chloride-sodium hydrochemical facies, stabilized at similar to 100 degrees C in crystalline basement rocks, which, according to seismic data, are located at similar to 3 km depth. The concentrations, patterns, and correlations of trace elements point out water-rock interaction processes between the deep water and basic magmatic rocks. The integration of the chemical and isotopic data and the surface geological context shows that the Goutitir water flows within a hydrothermal zone were basic to ultrabasic lamprophyres rich in gabbroic xenoliths outcrop, witnessing the existence, at depth, of basic plutons. Moreover, near the source, these veins are strongly altered and hydrothermalized, showing late recrystallization of centimetric-sized biotites. The chloride-sodium composition of this water may also be a testimony to the presence and reaction with the overlying Triassic saline and gypsiferous and Meso-Cenozoic mainly carbonated formations.

Modeling and simulation of the continuous production of an improved solar still coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal solar water heater system	DESALINATION			English	Article						Solar distillation; Reflectors; Nocturnal production; PV-SHW	THERMAL PERFORMANCE; DISTILLATION; COLLECTOR	This work aims at studying the productivity of a solar active still with a single basin liner and a single slope fitted with two reflectors coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal solar water heater system. The simulation input parameters include climatic conditions concerning the site of Ksar Challala (35.10 N, 2.19 E, Altitude: 800 m) in Algeria, for three typical days, one in each season (winter, spring and summer). The effect of the reflectors on the still daily production is larger during the winter compared with spring and summer. The rise in the production is respectively about 127.06% in winter, 21.78% in spring and 10.1% in summer. Moreover, it is obvious that the still nocturnal production increases when it is coupled with a storage tank either thermal or photovoltaic/thermal out of the sunshine duration. The increase for the still coupled with a thermal storage tank is estimated at about 17.36%, 28.34% and 33.00% respectively for winter, spring and summer. When the still is coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal storage tank, the production increase is very significant and estimated respectively at 47.61%, 137.50% and 131.06% for the winter, spring and summer.

The composition of the hot spring water is very comparable to the other thermal waters of the world. Thermodynamic considerations show that more than 65% of the groundwater and hot spring water samples are oversaturated with calcite, and only four samples are oversaturated with fluorite. Fluoride concentration shows a positive relation to sodium, bicarbonate and PH, and a negative relation to calcium and magnesium in fluoride-rich groundwater and hot spring water. Principal component analysis shows that the fluoride-rich groundwater was produced due to a mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. Studies of the saturation index of fluorite with log electrical conductivity also indicate mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. The spatial distribution of fluoride in groundwater follows the topography of the area.

J	SHANKS, WC; CALLENDER, E				SHANKS, WC; CALLENDER, E			THERMAL SPRINGS IN LAKE BAIKAL	GEOLOGY			English	Article							HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY; CHEMISTRY; OCEAN	Pore waters extracted from sediment cores were analyzed for their oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions and major ion chemistry to determine the source of water from a vent area for diffuse lake-bottom thermal springs or seeps in Frolikha Bay, northeastern Lake Baikal. The delta-O-18 values of pore waters range from -15.2 parts per thousand to -16.7 parts per thousand and delta-D values range from -119 parts per thousand to -126 parts per thousand (both isotopes determined relative to standard mean ocean water [SMOW]). Bottom water in Lake Baikal has a delta-O-18 value of -5.6 parts per thousand and a delta-D value of -120 parts per thousand. Pore waters in the vent area are significantly enriched in Mg, K, Ca, and especially Na and have the lowest delta-D and delta-O-18 values; these pore waters are isotopically and chemically distinct from pore waters in other, more typical parts of the lake. The pore-water isotopic data fall on a local meteoric water line, and covariations in water isotopes and chemistry are not consistent with evaporation or hydrothermal water-rock interaction. The thermal springs represent discharging meteoric waters that have been gently heated during subsurface circulation and are largely unaltered isotopically. Chemical variations are most likely due to dissolution of subsurface evaporites.

The study area is in the northern Pannonian part of Croatia which is characterized by a high geothermal gradient (0.049 degrees C/m) and surface heat flow (76 mW/m(2)). Although there are a lot of thermal occurrences in the study area, only ten were taken into consideration because there was a lack of geochemical data at other locations. The thermal springs considered are: Harina Zlaka, Krapinske toplice, Tuheljske toplice, Stubicke toplice, Sutinske toplice, Semnicke toplice, Toplicica (Madarevo), Toplicica (Gotalovec), Podevcevo, Vrazdinske toplice. A compilation of geochemical data from different sources together with our own measurements has been used in this study. The aim of this paper is to review the thermal waters' geochemical characteristics and demonstrate how these features can be used to discern their origin and the aquifer they equilibrated with. The geochemical characteristics of thermal waters of the study area suggest that the water is in equilibrium with dolomite which means that dolomite is the thermal aquifer in the study area.

Nondestructive experimental determination of bimaterial rectangular cantilever spring constants in water	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPE; OPTICAL SPOT SIZE; SURFACE STRESS; THERMAL NOISE; CALIBRATION; MICROCANTILEVER; SENSORS; FREQUENCY	In order to address the issue of spring constant calibration in viscous fluids such as water, a new method is presented that allows for the experimental calibration of bimaterial cantilever spring constants. This method is based on modeling rectangular cantilever beam bending as a function of changing temperature. The temperature change is accomplished by heating water as it flows around the cantilever beams in an enclosed compartment. The optical static method of detection is used to measure the deflection of cantilever at the free end. Experimentally determined results are compared to Sader's method and to the Thermotune method most commonly used in cantilever calibrations. Results indicate that the new bimaterial thermal expansion method is accurate within 15%-20% of the actual cantilever spring constant, which is comparable to other nondestructive calibration techniques.

J	Wang, Y; Consi, TR; Hansen, T; Janssen, J				Wang, Yu; Consi, Thomas R.; Hansen, Tom; Janssen, John			The relationship between coastal Mysis diluviana abundance and spring thermal bar dynamics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Hydrodynamics; Lake trout; Opossum shrimp; Stratification; Thermal bar	OPOSSUM SHRIMP; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; RELICTA; TEMPERATURE; ZOOPLANKTON; CONSUMPTION; MIGRATION; MICHIGAN; LAKES; DIET	We studied the density and age structure of Mysis diluviana in Lake Michigan with respect to spatial structure relating to spring thermal bar dynamics. The thermal bar is a zone of sinking 4 degrees C water that separates warmer inshore water from colder offshore water. The thermal bar migrates offshore as inshore water warms. The density of Mysis did not differ statistically between inshore (about 6 degrees C, as shallow as 17 m bottom depth) and offshore of the spring thermal bar, but the percentage of Mysis that were juveniles (<10 mm length) was significantly higher inshore (P = 0.011). Our data suggested that inshore Mysis may have an advantage in growth, but an impact on the entire population is unlikely. This study has important implications for both the predators and competitors of Mysis. First, the thermal bar period may be the most extended time that M. diluviana and the invasive Hemimysis anomala overlap spatially. Second, at the only well-studied Great Lakes lake trout nursery, a Lake Superior shallow reef, juvenile Mysis are important prey for lake trout fry (Salvelinus namaycush) which emerge and begin feeding in spring. Our study shows that Mysis are often abundant in coastal Lake Michigan water during the period when the lake begins to warm. Hence, lake trout restoration efforts for coastal spawning areas of the other Great Lakes may have potential Mysis-based nursery grounds essentially "on site," at or adjacent to spawning reefs.

It is a tradeoff between the hot spring use and river ecosystem. In order to understand details of the mechanisms connecting hot spring use and ecosystem, we investigated the river water quality and the water temperature from the upper reaches to the river mouth in the Hirata River. The results show that the hot spring drainage flowing in a specific section affects the estuary area. Additionally, it is revealed that the current average water temperature of hot spring drainage is very good condition for Nile tilapia in the estuary area. It is suggested that the tradeoffs between the hot spring use and the ecosystems can be resolved by suppressing high-temperature unused hot spring drainage, and/or by collecting hot spring drainage and reduce its average temperature further by using its thermal energy more extensively.

Because of the small difference between the temperatures in STEC plant, its thermal efficiency is low compared with those of other thermal power plants. In order to improve the thermal efficiency of STEC plant, a new power cycle, in which binary mixtures of water and ammonia were used as the working fluid, was developed recently. Because of the use of binary mixtures, there encounters a serious problem, about the composition of working fluid flowing into the turbine. If the composition of ammonia is not high enough, the working fluid may condense in the turbine, which results a fatal damage of turbine.

This study investigated the major elements, strontium, hydrogen, and oxygen isotopes of 22 sites in the thermal springs along the QHF from October to November 2020. The QHF hydrochemical system is recharged by meteoric water primarily infiltrating between 2.8 and 4.4 km a.s.l. Based on quartz geothermometers, the geothermal reservoir temperature variation ranged from 25.5 to 111.3?, and the circulation depth ranged from 1.3 to 5.6 km. In the QHF zone, the highest spring water temperature values were correlated with deep groundwater circulation circuits in areas where earthquake foci are concentrated. A conceptual model of the hydrologic cycle of thermal springs explains the spatial distribution of earthquakes associated with tectonic movements. The fluid circulation of the QHF corresponds well with the seismicity, which indicates that the hydrological characteristics of the thermal spring in a fault zone are vital in receiving information on seismic activity to assess the seismic risk of the QHF in the future.

H-O-C-S isotope and geochemical assessment of the geothermal area of Central Greece	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION			English	Article						Geochemistry; Water stable isotopes; Geothermometry; Aedipsos; Sperchios basin; Central Greece	CHEMICAL GEOTHERMOMETERS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; FLUID GEOCHEMISTRY; ORIGIN; WATERS; ARC; EQUILIBRIA; SEAWATER; ISLAND; DEPTH	A geochemical survey on the thermal fluids released by the geothermal system of Sperchios basin and Aedipsos area was undertaken. This geothermal area is characterized by high salinity associated with a degassing of CO2. In order to investigate the origin of thermal water, the mixing processes between meteoric, magmatic and sea water involved in the deep geothermal systems and subsequently to evaluate the deep aquifer temperature, chemical and isotopic content analyses (major elements, B, Li, O-18,H-2, C-13, S-34) have been carried out upon 59 thermal and cold water samples from springs and boreholes. The chemical and isotopic data of the thermal Cl-rich water springs of Thermopylae-Psoroneria-Kamena Vourla and Aedipsos suggest that they are fed by deep "parent" geothermal liquid mixed with local groundwater and seawater respectively. The deep geothermal liquid is a mixture of local groundwater (similar to 26.3%), seawater (similar to 56%) and magmatic water (similar to 17.7%). For Aedipsos thermal water the magmatic participation is between 5 and 10%, while in the case of Thermopylae, Psoroneria and Kamena Vourla magmatic contribution is between 1.5 and 3%. For the Hypati thermal water, the relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of water and Cl- content indicates significant delta O-18 enrichment with respect to local meteoric water, at least 2 parts per thousand, caused by the water-rock isotope exchange at relatively high temperatures. Carbon isotope analysis also confirms the participation of deep CO2 in the geothermal system: carbon source coming from mixing between magmatic and shallow "crustal" limestone (thermal or metamorphic decarbonation of limestone). Assessments from chemical and isotopic geothermometers applied on the thermal spring water suggest the probable existence of a deep geothermal reservoir of medium and high enthalpy.

Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the beneficial effects of thermal water continue for months following the completion of treatment. The mechanisms through which thermal water exerts its healing effects remain unknown. Both balneological and hydroponic therapy at 'the oldest spa in the world', namely, the Nitrodi spring on the Island of Ischia (Southern Italy) are effective in a number of diseases and conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular basis underlying the therapeutic effects of Nitrodi spring water in low-grade inflammation and stress-related conditions. For this purpose, an in vitro model was devised in which RKO colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were treated with phosphate-buffered saline or phosphate-buffered saline prepared with Nitrodi water for 4 h daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The RKO cells were then subjected to the following assays: 3-(4,5- Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell migration assay, western blot analysis, the fluorimetric detection of protein S-nitrosothiols and S-nitrosylation western blot analysis. The results revealed that Nitrodi spring water promoted cell migration and cell viability, and downregulated protein S-nitrosylation, probably also the nitrosylated active form of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein. These results concur with all the previously reported therapeutic properties of Nitrodi spring water, and thus rein-force the concept that this natural resource is an important complementary therapy to traditional medicine.

Further, the increasing use of thermal springs for bathing necessitates additional studies focused on not only typical streams but also thermal spring conditions, where water temperature is relatively higher than typical streams. This study was conducted to assess the survival of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium in stream water under free floating and particle-attached conditions at a range of temperature. A series of microcosm studies were conducted to determine pathogen decay rates. In bench-scale experiments, water circulation and sediment resuspension mimicked natural stream and thermal spring conditions, with continuous air flow providing aeration, constant mixing and turbulent conditions, and improved water circulation. Data on E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella survival were subsequently used to determine first-order decay equations for calculating the rate constant and decimal reduction time for the modeled experimental conditions. Results showed that at 40 degrees C, the survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 was longer than that of particle attached Salmonella. Under free floating condition, Salmonella survived longer than E. coli O157:H7. At 50 degrees C, survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella was longer than that of free floating E. coli and Salmonella. At 60 degrees C, survival of particle attached Salmonella was longer than that of free floating Salmonella. Similarly at 60 degrees C, the survival of E. coli O157:H7 under particle attached condition was longer than that of the free floating condition. The findings of this study suggest that the survival of E. coli O157:H7 differs than the survival of Salmonella in stream water and thermal spring conditions, and the assumption used in previous studies to estimate survival of bacteria in stream environment could result in over/ underestimation if the impact of particle attachment on pathogen survival is not accounted for.

Spring discharge and thermal regime of a groundwater dependent ecosystem in an arid karst environment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Karst hydrology; Springs; Refugia; Climate change; Fisheries	STREAM TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALASMIDONTA-HETERODON; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; WATER TEMPERATURE; DEVILS RIVER; FLOW; FISH; HYDROLOGY; REFUGIA	In semi-arid regions, groundwater-dependent ecosystems rely on stable hydro-thermal regimes where refugia have supported aquatic biota for millennia. In karst systems, springs provide consistent flows and stenothermal conditions that buffer extremes. Our objective was to assess the impacts of spring discharge on instream temperatures, using the pristine Devils River in Texas as a case study, where climate change and groundwater development threaten to reduce spring flows and aquatic habitats of protected species (Devils River minnow and Texas hornshell mussel). Instream temperatures and discharge were monitored for three years above and below the Finegan Spring complex. These time series were extended back 30 years using temperature data from North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) land surface models. Monitoring data revealed that springs contributed similar to 40% of total river discharge. Spring temperatures were consistently 22.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C providing thermal refugia to 200 m of river-cooling the streamflow in summer and warming it in winter, with a noted stratification overturning each winter. High correlations between NLDAS air and soil temperatures and instream temperatures allowed the water temperature record to be extended over 30 years. While air and soil temperatures increased 0.35 degrees C and 0.30 degrees C per decade, spring inputs from karst aquifer buffer downstream temperature increases to 0.12 degrees C per decade. Furthermore, spring discharge reduced the duration of extreme thermal habitat thresholds by 50-70%. A similar approach could be applied to other groundwater dependent ecosystems with sparse temperature data. The results underscore the importance of spring discharge in maintaining heterogeneous aquatic habitats in karst terrain.

History of thermalism at Avene-les-Bains and genesis of the Avene thermal spring water	ANNALES DE DERMATOLOGIE ET DE VENEREOLOGIE			French	Article						Avene; Thermalism; Hydrogeology; Cosmetics		Avene thermal spring water is recognized for more than two centuries for its benefits on skin diseases. Since 1975, the Pierre Fabre Group has modernized the facilities, and developed the brand "Eau Thermal Avene", allowing more than 2,500 patients/year to be treated by this therapeutic water. The regulation requires high standards on origin, bacteriological purity and physico-chemical stability. Many works have allowed us to understand its origin, its underground path and identify its specific physico-chemical profile. Finally, thanks to its therapeutic properties verified in various clinical studies, the "Eau Thermal Avene" is the first active ingredient of a variety of products for sensitive skin. (C) 2017.

Composition, structure, and distribution of diatom assemblages in Mediterranean thermal spring ecotones affected by natural and human disturbances	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Bacillariophyceae; Disturbances; Ecotones; Temporary flooding; Mediterranean area; Thermal springs	GEOTHERMAL DIATOMS; LIMPOPO PROVINCE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; SARDINIA; QUALITY; BIODIVERSITY; BACILLARIOPHYTA; INDEXES; RIVER	Springs are unique aquatic environments that significantly contribute to regional and global biodiversity but are also susceptible to disturbances because of their small size. Mediterranean thermal springs remain poorly studied, and little is known about how different environmental and disturbance factors affect their aquatic communities. In this study, we analyzed diatom assemblages from six thermal springs of Sardinia (Italy), both isolated and connected to river systems, their relationship with environmental variables, ecotonal properties (i.e., transition of springs with terrestrial and/or river environments) and primary sources of disturbance. A total of 196 species (65 genera) were found from two substrates (cobbles and surface sediments). Overall, low discharge and ecotonal properties, influenced by natural and human disturbances (temporary flooding, water abstraction and recreational activities), contribute to form heterogeneous diatom assemblages composed of aquatic-aerial, aerial and planktonic species. Springs connected to rivers and that are more disturbed showed a higher presence of planktonic and habitat generalist species and a higher species richness, diversity and evenness than more isolated springs. By contrast, the latter seems to harbor smaller pools of taxa with crenophilous species and species with a preference for less disturbed habitats or with more restricted geographical distribution. Water temperature, "river influence," discharge, orthophosphates and dissolved inorganic nitrogen played a major role in shaping diatom assemblages. Our results indicate that diatoms can provide helpful information about the ecological functioning of thermal springs and can be an effective tool to track their environmental changes related to the increasing natural and human pressures in the Mediterranean area.

The Geochemistry of Acid Thermal Waters on Urup Island, Kuril Islands	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY			English	Article						thermal waters; island; volcano; isotope composition; trace elements	HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; SOLUTE FLUXES; VOLCANO; TRANSPORT; ARC	The data acquired during the field work in 2017 were used to carry out a comprehensive geochemical study of thermal occurrences on Urup Island, which is part of the southern Kuril island arc. It was shown that the thermal waters of Berg Volcano concentrated in the caldera which is open westward at various distances from the extrusive dome are warm (T up to 40 degrees C), acid (pH 3.5-3.8) of the SO4-Cl-Ca type with mineral content reaching 2.5 g/L. The springs of Tri Sestry Volcano situated at its base near Cape Klyuchevoi have temperatures reaching 45 degrees C, pH < 3, and are of the SO4-Cl-Ca type with mineral content reaching 1.9 g/L. The isotope composition of water in these two groups of springs is close to that of local meteoric water. The ratios between the concentrations of main cations and the microcomponent composition are generally in agreement with the composition of the host rocks. We note that the Berg Volcano springs show a well-pronounced negative Eu anomaly in the distribution of rare earth elements. The anion composition, the isotope composition of sulfur in the dissolved sulfate (between +15.2 and +21.6 parts per thousand), as well as the Cl/B and Cl/Br ratios, all indicate the involvement of magmatic volatiles in the formation of these waters. The total measured discharge of Cl and SO4 by the Berg springs is 9 +/- 1.3 t/d and 23.3 +/- 3.4 t/d, that for the springs on Cape Klyuchevoi is 0.5 +/- 0.2 t/d and 2.3 +/- 0.8 t/d, respectively. A preliminary estimate for the chemical erosion affecting the Berg Volcano edifice by thermal waters is 700-800 t/km(2)/yr.	[Kalacheva, E. G.; Taran, Yu. A.; Kotenko, T. A.; Voloshina, E.

Approximately 250 thermal springs and artificial wells are known, as well as spring clusters with water temperatures between 30 degrees C and 108 degrees C. The majority of these thermal water deposits have decreased well pressures due to irrational exploitation and climate change effects. In some cases, the complete termination of outflow has been observed. Based on the number of observed resources and their thermal potential, exploitation of thermal water deposits in the Tbilisi region is the most promising; thus, the assessment of its conditions are regarded as an important national priority. This paper summarizes the geothermal potential of the Tbilisi region based on development and application of a coupled 3D groundwater model using existing and newly obtained geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical data.

J	Darling, WG				Darling, W. George			Thermal groundwaters of the UK: geochemical indications of flow, vulnerability and possible threat to the shallow hydrosphere	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY			English	Article							GEOTHERMAL-EXPLORATION; MINE DRAINAGE; WATERS; DERBYSHIRE; WELL	Three types of thermal groundwater are known from the UK: warm springs (<= 45 degrees C), mine inflows (<= 50 degrees C) and deep basin waters (<= 80 degrees C). The warm springs depend on Carboniferous Limestone conveying water to sufficient depth (600-3000 m) to acquire a significantly higher temperature. The springs have residence times of a few thousand years, but also contain <= 5% modern groundwater. Their water quality is little threat to the environment; the main danger to the springs is construction activity near the emergences. Mine inflows significantly >20 degrees C are known only from Cornish granite. High dissolved 4 He has been interpreted as indicating long residence of the thermal component, but there is also modern water in the system, leading to uncertainty in the mean age. Unpredictable fracturing could hinder development of this resource, while the seawater-like salinity, combined with the presence of toxic metals, would require treatment or re-injection of the spent water to protect the near-surface environment. Mesozoic sedimentary basin brines reach temperatures >60 degrees C, suitable for district heating. This resource is large and effectively invulnerable. However, these waters are generally more saline than seawater and, while disposal of spent brine could take place into the sea under favourable conditions, re-injection would be necessary for inland sites.

J	Olichwer, T; Tarka, R				Olichwer, Tomasz; Tarka, Robert			Determination of the circulation depth and reservoir tem-peratures of thermal waters in the southern Spitsbergen using geothermometry	EPISODES			English	Article							HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SVALBARD; SPRINGS; SULFATE; HYDROCHEMISTRY; TEMPERATURE; GROUNDWATER; BOCKFJORDEN; SULFUR	The aim of article is determining the circulation depth and reservoir temperatures of thermal springs in the southern Spitsbergen using selected geothermometers which are in particular suitable for systems under low enthalpy condi-tions. For the analysis of the thermal waters circulation, the six thermal springs were selected. The conducted cal-culations of reservoir water temperatures for the thermal outflows showed that the most homogeneous temperature range was obtained for the Na-K-Ca, K-Mg, Ca-Mg, and Na-Li geothermometers as well as for the silica geother-mometer using the mixing model. The derived tempera-ture values demonstrate the existence of two depth zones of thermal water formation. The first shallower zone, up to a depth of 1.1 km, is associated with water circulation in the fault zones of metamorphosed carbonate rocks of the Hecla Hoek succession in the region of the Hornsund fjord and Raudfjellet massif. This zone is characterized by reservoir water temperatures of about 40 degrees C. The sec-ond deeper zone of thermal waters in the Sorkappland area (Stormbukta area), with a temperature of about 80 degrees C, corresponds to the groundwater reservoir located at a depth of 2.3 km. The thermal waters here are associated with sedimentary rocks of the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic periods. Na-K geothermometer gives results consistent with the above-mentioned geothermometers only in the case of mature or partially mature waters (only Sorkappland area). Furthermore the original silica content (30 mg/kg) in the hot water, estimated by authors using mixing model, indi-cates that in the thermal water outflows of southern Spits-bergen the percentage of cold shallow circulation waters is about 85%, while the percentage of deep circulation thermal waters is 15%. The application of comprehensive solutions such as the simultaneous use of a number of dif-ferent geothermometers, supported by the mixing models, allows us to determine temperatures in deep hot water reservoirs.

Periodic surveys revealed that the discharge continued for more than 7 years, which is a rare and valuable long-term record of hot spring discharge triggered by an earthquake in a non-volcanic area. In terms of coseismic changes, based on a comparison of the spatial distribution of changes in the coseismic water head and calculated crustal volumetric strain using a fault model, hot spring water discharge was found to be caused by a change in the coseismic crustal volumetric strain. As for the postseismic changes, observations over 7 years revealed a gradual rise in the temperature and chloride ion concentration of the hot spring water. Such long-term hot spring discharge may be explained by the following two causes: the rise of thermal water from the deep part and the permeability changes along the hot spring channels.

Catchment-Scale Permafrost Mapping using Spring Water Characteristics	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES			English	Article						spring water; permafrost mapping; rock glaciers; Eastern Italian Alps	EASTERN ITALIAN ALPS; ROCK GLACIERS; MOUNTAIN PERMAFROST; ORTLES-CEVEDALE; ALPINE PERMAFROST; THERMAL REGIMES; BERNESE ALPS; INVENTORY; TEMPERATURE; SURFACE	This study presents a method for mapping the spatial distribution of mountain permafrost based on the chemical-physical characterisation of spring water in a 36km(2) high-elevation catchment in the Eastern Italian Alps. Water temperature, electrical conductivity and isotopic composition (H-2 and O-18) were measured in 45 springs during summer 2007, 2010 and 2012. Existing evidence of permafrost enabled the areas upslope of springs to be classified into two categories of permafrost occurrence (probable permafrost and no permafrost) and used to determine the most suitable tracer for permafrost mapping. Springs from probable permafrost areas have a specific water temperature signature. Spring water temperature was therefore used as a response variable in multiple linear regression, and mean elevation and mean clear sky radiation of spring upslope areas were used as predictors. The multiple regression models were statistically significant and used to map the potential spatial distribution of spring water temperature, which was reclassified into three permafrost categories (probable, possible and improbable). Cross-validation and independent validation by ground surface temperature data provided evidence that the spring water temperature can be used alone for easy and low-cost assessment of the catchment-scale permafrost distribution in similar alpine catchments.

For 40 samples of bottled mineral water, the mean gross alpha activity concentration was determined to be 164 mBq l(1) (min.:7 mBq l(1); max.: 3042 mBq l(1)), whereas the gross beta activity concentration was found to be 555 mBq l(1) (min.: 21 mBq l(1); max.: 4845 mBq l(1)). For 24 samples of thermal spring water, the mean gross alpha activity concentration was obtained to be 663 mBq l(1) (min.: 18 mBq l(1); max.: 3070 mBq l(1)). The gross beta activity concentration for these samples, on the other hand, was determined to be 3314 mBq l(1) (min.: 79 mBq l(1); max.: 17955 mBq l(1)). These values lead to the average annual effective doses of 313 Sv for mineral waters and 1805 Sv for thermal spa waters, which are found to be higher than those recommended for drinking waters by the World Health Organization. It should be noted, however, that one will get less dose from mineral waters since the daily consumption is much lower than 2 l that these calculations assume.

Occurrence of soluble organic compounds in thermal waters by ion trap mass detection	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Thermal waters; Soluble organic compounds; Gas chromatography-electron impact ion; trap mass spectrometry; Liquid-liquid extraction; Solid phase extraction; Solid phase micro-extraction	EAST PACIFIC RISE; SPRINGS; BASIN; HYDROCARBONS; PETROLEUM; VOLATILE; ORIGIN; ZONE; SITE	Thermal waters can be regarded as worth developing because of their human health implications and, if thermal tourism is promoted, their importance to the local economy. Galicia, in the North-West of Spain, has numerous sources of thermal waters spread all over the region. They have been used for therapeutic purposes since Roman times. Ourense, with 82 sources (9 spas), is becoming one of the richest Spanish provinces in hydromineral and thermal resources. In this work, the most representative springs of thermal waters from the city of Ourense - Outariz, Chavasqueira, Tinteiro and As Burgas - were analysed in order to identify the presence of several chemical classes of soluble organic compounds responsible for their biological activity. The waters studied are hyperthermal, with temperatures ranged between 45 and 66 degrees C. Different extraction techniques, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid phase extraction (SPE) and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME), combined with gas chromatography-electron impact ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-(EI)ITMS) were used to cover a wide variety of compounds. The most characteristic chemical families of extractable organic Compounds detected are thoroughly discussed. Most of the substances belonging to phenol, aldehyde, esther, ketone, and elemental Sulphur groups occur in all samples. Large amounts of elemental sulphur were found in Tinteiro spring, providing to this water of numerous beneficial clinical effects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several references to the springs from Saxon times and the Middle Ages give qualitative information of interest for the present day. The springs have drawn some of the most famous philosophers and scientists to test new theories and develop hypotheses on the nature of matter and to develop early ideas in the chemical and geological sciences. Theories on the hydrological cycle and on hydrogeology were tested and the springs have a long history as a site for discoveries in chemistry and natural radioactivity. Interest in the springs continues to the present day. Whilst our knowledge of the origin of the water, the heat, the detailed chemistry and other properties has been resolved, some questions still remain for the attention of future generations and for the application of advancing scientific methods.

Thermal manifestations in Eastern Cordillera (Reyes) and part of those in the western sector of sub-Andean Range (Aguas Calientes) are fed by shallow aquifers, interacting with Quaternary- Neogene rocks and the upper portion of Pliocene-Miocene formations (Oran Group), whereas the meteoric water recharge area is located at > 2500 m a.s.l., corresponding to Chaff]. hill. Differently, El Jordan thermal spring in the sub-Andean Range is fed by a hydrothermal aquifer hosted within highly porous and fractured formations of the Salta Group (Yacoraite Formation) and recharged by meteoric water from Sierra de Calilegua (similar to 1500 m a.s.l.). The latter is the recharge area of the La Quinta geothermal waters as well, but these have been fed at higher altitudes ( > 2500 m a.s.l.) in the range. The hydrothermal reservoir feeding the other thermal springs from the Santa Barbara system (Caimancito, El Palmar, and Siete Aguas) is recharged by meteoric water from Zapla Ranges and Santa Barbara Hill at < 2500 m a.s.l. The high-TDS ( > 16,000 mg/L) Na+-Cl- La Quinta thermal springs are produced by interaction with the evaporite deposits of Salta Group, including halite, whereas the chemistry of El Palmar, El Jordan and Caimancito thermal springs, showing a Na+-SO42-(Cl-) composition, depends on mixing with shallower SO42--rich waters interacting with gypsum deposits of Anta Formation. Dissolved and bubbling gases from all the investigated provinces are related to CO2- and CH4-rich crustal fluids produced by both thermogenic processes occurring within the hydrothermal systems and microbial activity at relatively low depth, with low to negligible mantle contribution, as indicated by the He-3/He-4 values <= 0.21 Ra. The fluid reservoir feeding the Quinta thermal springs shows the highest estimated temperatures ( > 200 degrees C), which, considering the depth of Salta Group in the Santa Barbara system (similar to 2000 m), support the idea, suggested by previous authors, of an anomalous geothermal gradient for this area, a promising pre-requisite for future exploitation of the geothermal resource.

There is a common belief that hot spring bathing has therapeutic effects for wound healing, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of Nagano hot spring water (rich in carbonate ion, 42 degrees C) on the healing process of the skin using a nude rat skin wound model. We found that hot spring bathing led to an enhanced healing speed compared to both the unbathed and hot-water (42 degrees C) control groups. Histologically, the hot spring water group showed increased vessel density and reduced inflammatory cells in the granulation tissue of the wound area. Real-time RT-PCR analysis along with zymography revealed that the wound area of the hot spring water group exhibited a higher expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 compared to the two other control groups. Furthermore, we found that the enhanced wound healing process induced by the carbonate ion-enriched hot spring water was mediated by thermal insulation and moisture maintenance. Our results provide the evidence that carbonate ion-enriched hot spring water is beneficial for the treatment of skin wounds.

The structural history of this area is complex and it is unknown whether these natural springs receive significant recharge from modern precipitation or whether they discharge old water recharged over geological times scales. The main objective of this study was to use stable isotopes of water ( and ), dissolved inorganic carbon () and dissolved sulfate ( and ) to delineate sources of water, carbon and sulfur in several natural springs of the region. Our preliminary isotope data indicate that all springs are being recharged by modern precipitation. The oxygen isotope composition indicates that waters in thermal springs did not encounter the high temperatures required for O isotope exchange between the water and silicate/carbonate minerals, and/or the residence time of water in the aquifers was short due to high flow rates. The carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfur/oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate provide evidence of low-temperature water-rock interactions and various biogeochemical transformations these waters have undergone along their flow path.

J	Birdwell, JE; Engel, AS				Birdwell, Justin E.; Engel, Annette Summers			Characterization of dissolved organic matter in cave and spring waters using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUATIC HUMIC SUBSTANCES; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; BACTERIAL PRODUCTION; HUMIFICATION INDEX; FULVIC-ACIDS; TERRESTRIAL; MARINE; EXCITATION; SPECTRA; COASTAL	Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was examined using fluorescence and absorbance spectra from sulfidic cave and thermal and non-thermal surface-discharging spring waters. Many of the sites have a limited allochthonous supply of organic matter (OM) and contain ecosystems that are dependent on chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities. Water-extracted OM from microbial mats at the sites had fluorescence signatures consistent with the fluorescent amino acids. Based on fluorescence-derived indices and absorbance spectral characteristics, the origin of the cave and spring CDOM appeared to be from microbially-derived material, and the degree of OM humification was low. Little of the CDOM pool was represented by terrestrial humic fluorescence signatures, which are typically observed in surface waters, as well as soil and sediment porewaters.

J	Bozdag, A				Bozdag, Ayla			Hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of Kayak (Seydisehir-Konya) geothermal field, Turkey	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hydrogeochemistry; Thermal waters; Geothermometry; Fluid-mineral equilibria; Kayak geothermal field	THERMAL WATERS; HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS; MINERAL EQUILIBRIA; AREA; HYDROCHEMISTRY; ANATOLIA; SPRINGS	The Kayak geothermal field is located 13 km north of Seydisehir town, about 90 km southwest of Konya Province in the Central Anatolia, Turkey. This study was carried out to determine the origin, chemical characteristics, and isotopic composition of Kayak thermal waters. The measured temperatures of thermal and mineral waters range from 21.5 to 26 degrees C with a discharge of 0.8 l/s in springs, and from 30 to 45.8 degrees C with a discharge of 185 l/s in wells. Thermal and/or mineralized spring and well waters are of Ca-Na-HCO3 types with electrical conductivity ranging from 2530 to 4150 mu S/cm while cold groundwater is mainly of Ca-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-HCO3 types with electrical conductivity ranging from 446 to 668 mu S/cm. Kayak thermal waters have not reached complete chemical re-equilibrium possibly as a result of mixing with cold water during upward flow. Assessments from quartz geothermometers and fluid mineral equilibria calculations suggest that reservoir temperature of Kayak geothermal field ranges from 68 to 105 degrees C. Thermal waters are oversaturated at discharge temperatures for calcite, dolomite, and aragonite minerals corresponding to travertine precipitation in the discharge area. Gypsum and anhydrite minerals are undersaturated in all the thermal waters. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 compositions of Kayak thermal and cold waters point to a meteoric origin. Meteoric waters infiltrate the reservoir rocks along faults and fracture zones. After being heated at depth with the high geothermal gradient, they move up to the surface along faults and fractures that act as pathways. Additionally, delta O-18 and delta H-2 values suggest that thermal waters are recharged from higher elevations in comparison with cold waters. Long-term circulation of meteoric waters within the basement rocks is indicated by low tritium (<2 TU) values in the thermal waters, although the fluids do not achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the delta C-13 values, carbon in thermal waters is considered as originating from a mixture of marine carbonates and CO2 gas of volcanic (mantle) origin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This zone contains the largest number of thermal springs in North Algeria. Such springs are mainly associated with diapiric geological formations. This work focuses on the diapiric area sited near the Algerian-Tunisian border, where the hydrothermal complex is located. This hydrothermal complex occurs primarily within karstified Cretaceous carbonates. Source of the recorded data, issued from emerging thermal springs associated with the considered region. The discharge temperatures of these thermal springs range between 25 and 40 degrees C. The combined use of hydrogeochemical, strontium isotope, and geothermometric analyses showed that the thermal fluids were a mixture of karstic cold water of meteoric origin and salt water; it is supposed that the deep thermal salt aquifer discharges its waters into the upper karstic levels. The occurrence of water mineralization may be due to the presence of a Triassic evaporite formation. The high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio (0.709007) of the thermal waters (in the case of source S2) arising from the graben may reflect the dissolution of minerals rich in Sr-87, such as salt clay deposits. These deposits are probably sourced from the Triassic formation at a certain depth. Silica geothermometers indicated that the temperature of the reservoir was 71 degrees C below the graben. The overall process can be related to the infiltration of meteoric waters to a calculated depth of 1.77 km. The heating of the considered water types can be assigned to the presence of heat anomalies. The area is affected by a geothermal gradient of 4 degrees C/100 m on average. This situation is most likely due to the complexity of the geological setting. The rising waters circulate through the deep and shallow fracture systems surrounding the graben formation. During their ascent, the fluids mix with shallow and cold groundwater. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the overall fluid characteristics observed in the case study may suggest that the geothermal complex has low enthalpy.

The current research, carried out on Bahia Concepcion, evidences the existence of geothermal springs, which get recharged mainly by groundwater and seawater. The groundwater can be characterized as Na+-Cl- and Na+-HCO3- type, with a pH value close to neutrality. The slightly more acidic thermal sites presented temperatures between 32 degrees C and 59 degrees C at the surface. Based on the relationships of the Cl- and Br-, as well as the B/Cl-, and Br-/Cl- ratios, seawater was recognized as the main source of salinity. The spatial distribution is explained directly through marine intrusion, or via sprays and aerosols within the rainwater. Seawater ratios in thermal springs varied from 62% to 83%, corresponding mainly to shallow inflow, but seawater inputs into the deep thermal reservoir were also recognized. Temperatures in the geothermal deep reservoir were inferred from 114 to 209 degrees C, calculated through the SiO2 and Na+-K+ geothermometers. In addition to previously reported thermal sites at Bahia Concepcion, and based on their elevated temperatures, two new sites were identified. Another five springs do not fulfill the commonly used definition, based on differential temperature, but show the typical hydrogeochemical signature of thermal water. A new approach to identify this low-temperature geothermal-influenced spring water by its hydrogeochemical composition is presented, for which the term "Masked Geothermal Waters" (MGW) is introduced. Our findings increase the area of the geothermal anomaly and, therefore, the potential of geothermal resources. The approach proposed in this research will also be useful to identify more MGW in other coastal areas.

In-situ measurements of surface water temperature and water depth, as well as meteorological data, were used in the analysis. Images of the Landsat 8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared (IR) Sensors) at IR channels were taken from the data archives of United State Geological Survey (USGS), and were validated with surface in-situ measurements. Specific Electrical conductivity (SEC) measurements done at the bottom of the lake were also used for a better understanding of the water thermal stratification and types (cold/hot) that impact on the underwater physical properties of the lake. In-situ measurements at the water surface were interpolated using a new method known as 'Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK)'. The 2D and 3D (dimensional) temperature maps were generated using the Delaunay triangulation technique which utilizes nearest neighbor interpolation method. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R-2) between water surface temperatures (WST) from in-situ measurements and IR channels is found to be greater than 0.86. The analysis of 2D and 3D temperature mapping of the lake water revealed evidences for subaqueous cold spring occurrence in the northern part and subaqueous hot springs in the south-western part of Koycegiz Lake. It is concluded that correlating in-situ water temperature measurements to Landsat 8 TIRS images is an efficient method for temporal and spatial evaluation of lake water characteristics.

Methods and results Detection of Legionella by culture was done by using two methods, direct culture on agar plates and co-culture with amoeba. Fifty samples were taken from different hot springs in northern Algeria, including swimming pools, showers and thermal sources.Legionella pneumophilaserotypes were predominant, accounting for 60% of positive samples. Direct method allowed the isolation of 13L. pneumophilaonly of 50 samples (26%), whereas co-culture using a panel of three free living amoeba allowed the isolation of 119Legionellaspecies from the same samples (80%) Conclusions Amoeba co-culture allowed the isolation of severalLegionellasp., while direct culture allowed the isolation ofL. pneumophilaonly. Remarkably,Legionella longbeachae, usually isolated from soil and compost, was isolated for the first time in thermal water in three samples usingVermamoeba vermiformisco-culture.

J	Bo, Y; Liu, CL; Zhao, YJ; Wang, LC				Bo, Ying; Liu, Chenglin; Zhao, Yanjun; Wang, Licheng			Chemical and isotopic characteristics and origin of spring waters in the Lanping-Simao Basin, Yunnan, Southwestern China	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Spring; Hydrochemistry; Reservoir temperature; Isotope; Evolution; Lanping-Simao	THERMAL GROUNDWATER; HELIUM; AREA; EVOLUTION; RIVER; NEON	The chemical and isotopic characteristics (oxygen, hydrogen, and strontium) of spring waters and isotopic compositions of helium (He) and neon (Ne) in gases escaping from spring waters in the Lanping-Simao Basin are studied. A total of twenty-one spring water samples (twelve hot springs, four cold springs, and five saline springs) and eleven gas samples were collected from the study area, including one spring and one gas sample from northern Laos. It is found that saline spring waters in the study area are of chloride type, cold spring waters are of carbonate type or sulfate type, and hot spring waters are of various types. High total dissolved solids levels in saline springs are significantly related to Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene salt-bearing strata. On the basis of hydrochemical geothermometry, the reservoir temperatures (T-r) for hot springs, cold springs, and saline springs are 65.5-144.1,37.8-64.4, and 65.1-109.0 degrees C, respectively, and the circulation depths of saline springs are much larger than those of hot and cold springs. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of springs in the Lanping-Simao Basin and northern Laos are primarily controlled by meteoric waters with obvious latitude and altitude effects, and are also influenced by 8180 exchange to some extent. Most Sr2+ in spring waters of the study area is derived from varied sources (carbonate, evaporite, and silicate mineral dissolution), and the Sr isotopic compositions are greatly influenced by volcanic rocks. Wide distribution of crust-derived He in the Lanping-Simao Basin and northern Laos reveal that faults in these areas may not descend to the upper mantle. It is concluded that water circulation in the study area may be limited above the upper mantle, while saline springs may originate from the Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene evaporites. Hydrochemical characteristics demonstrate affinities among the Lanping-Simao Basin, northern Laos, and Yanjing, eastern Tibet, while disaffinities are observed between these areas and Tengchong on the basis of the hydrochemical characteristics and noble gas isotopic compositions.

In 19th Century a chemist identified anomalous behaviour of the thermal waters in concomitance with local seismic events. Recent studies assessed the geochemical features of the circulating fluids (e.g., waters carry a dissolved CH(4)-dominated gas phase with a radiogenic signature of the helium isotopic ratio) and observed anomalous hydrologic and geochemical signals possibly related to crustal strain phenomena due to local seismic events. Long-term geochemical monitoring was-carried out from 2001 to 2006 with the aim of detecting the behaviour of the circulating fluids possibly coinciding with seismic activity. The collected data reveal a sensitivity of the thermal waters to the activity of the main fault crossing the village of Porretta and identify a << oseismogenic >> structure crossing the village.

Optimal thermal water locations along the Gulf of Suez coastal zones, Egypt	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal water; Coastal zone; Remote sensing analysis; Surface temperature; GIS technique	CALIBRATION; SEA	Remote sensing and GIS techniques were utilized to specify criteria characterizing thermal water localities along the Gulf of Suez coastal zones. Surface temperatures were extracted from ETM+ (band 6) and AVHRR image data. Specific sites were characterized by high surface temperatures: 31-34 degrees C at Ayun Musa, 31-37 degrees C at Ain El Sukhna, and 34-43 degrees C at Hammam Faraun. The results were consistent with measurements taken during field visits. These springs are located in regions of tectonic heating due to the opening of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez rifts. The heat for these springs is probably derived from high heat flow and deep circulation controlled by faults associated with rift opening. Data fusion was applied to ETM+ and ASTER images from 2000 to extract information about lineaments and major structures controlling hot spring distribution and geothermal localities in the Gulf of Suez area. The major geologic structures were oriented to NNW-SSE-trending faults. Principal component analyses and image classification techniques were applied to construct rock unit maps. The hot spring sites are covered by wadi deposits and surrounded by fractured Eocene limestone. The thermal water areas are characterized by low topography and high-order drainage patterns flowing toward the Gulf of Suez coastal zones. The results of this study indicate that localities most likely to contain thermal water along the Gulf of Suez are covered with fractured Eocene limestone and characterized, by low topography, high-order drainage patterns, and surface temperatures ranging from 34 degrees C to 43 degrees C. These criteria can help in predicting the locations of other hot spring areas and selecting optimum sites for the generation of thermal energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kaiser, M.

Environmental Geochemistry of Potentially Toxic elements in thermal springs in the Sabalan Volcanic Field, NW Iran	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HEAVY METALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT	E3S Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Heavy Metals in the Environment (ICHMET)	SEP 23-27, 2012	Rome, ITALY			Environmental Geochemistry; Sabalan; Thermal Springs; Trace elements; Arsenic contamination; Iran	HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS; GEOTHERMAL AREA; WESTERN TURKEY; WATERS; GROUNDWATERS	Thermal springs are widely used by tourists for treatment of dermal diseases and other therapeutic applications. In Iran, thermal springs occur in Northwestern part mainly surrounding the Mount Sabalan which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists annually. Two clusters of springs in Neer and Meshkinshahr areas including 16 thermomineralic springs have been studied in this research and they were sampled twice in May and November in order to investigate the seasonal changes of trace elements in dry and wet seasons. The samples were analyzed in Acme Lab, Canada for 72 elements. Trace element concentrations indicate that most of the elements show concentration well beyond the guideline values for drinking water. While the two sets of samples were taken within a 6 months interval, the elements show slight or no variation from first period to the second and in some cases. Arsenic shows a variation of 5-5834 mu g/l and the mean As value is 160 times the guideline values (10 mu g/l). Other toxic elements with high concentration are B, Fe, Mn, Sb, and Si. Mn and Sb shows exeedance of 12 and 11.5 times respectively. Correlation coefficient and principal component analysis of analytical data indicate that Cl, As, B, Ba, Br, and V show very strong mutual correlation coefficients implying their relationship and common source and fate in the hydrothermal fluid carrying them. These elements fall in the component 1 of PCA. This group of elements is supposed to be derived and sourced from the magmatic-hydrothermal system and through the interaction of hydrothermal fluids with rocks they passed through. Because of discharge of the thermal springs into the nearby streams intended to be used for drinking water and also vast application of spring waters in balneological uses, they may have adverse environmental and health impacts on tourists that expose themselves to this contaminants through balneological applications.

In fact, several thermal springs emerge in coastal and inland areas of the Aysen region. Thermal springs in the coastal areas are spatially related to the Liquine-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS), a major strike-slip fault system that runs along the southern segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone, and could be controlling groundwater circulation. Despite the existence of literature regarding the composition of thermal springs, they do not elucidate the origin of thermal waters, the source of their chemical components nor have their hydrogeochemical processes been investigated. This knowledge will provide a useful tool for exploration of geothermal resources in the Aysen region. Sixteen thermal waters, three fjord waters, and three meteoric water samples were collected and analysed for major-minor ions, some trace elements (B, Li) and stable isotopes of delta H-2 and delta O-18. Classic geochemical tools (i.e.: ratio of elements, ion vs chloride content), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Factorial Analysis (FA) suggest there are three water groups (G1, G2 and G3). G1 and G3 are Na-Cl type coastal thermal springs with electrical conductivity (EC) above 1000 mu S/cm and mostly neutral pH (6.4 to 8.4). G1 has the highest average concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, Na+, Ca2+ while G3 has the highest values T degrees, SiO2, HCO3-, Li, B. The G2 samples are from Aysen inland areas, have EC below 1000 mu S/cm, slightly alkaline pH (7.9 to 9.6) and are Na-Cl-HCO3 type with higher average values of T degrees, SiO2, HCO3- and Li than G1. Factorial analysis indicates that two factors explain 82.1% of the total dataset variance. Factor 1 is formed by Cl-, SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, Li and B, which we associated with fjord water mixing processes. The factor 2 formed by T degrees, SiO2, HCO3-, Li and B might be interpreted as: i) silicate weathering from the North Patagonian Batholith and ii) volatile elements transported through high temperature vapours from a volcanic degassing source. These two components which could interact and overlap are address as "magmatic-hydrothermal" in this work. The factorial scores distribution is consistent with the HCA suggesting that fjord water mixing is the dominant geochemical process for G1 samples while G2 samples are influenced by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The G3 thermal waters show both processes with a greater influence of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The calculated saline factor (3.4% to 42.3%) supports fjord water mixing processes as one of the dominant processes affecting the coastal thermal spring's composition. The stable isotopic data (delta H-2 and delta O-18) fall in the local meteoric water line (LMWL), suggesting current recharge and limited oxygen isotopic exchange during rock-dissolution processes. This could indicate short residence times and/or abundant contribution of actual meteoric water at shallow depths.

Fluid geochemistry of the Methana Peninsula and Loutraki geothermal area, Greece	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION			English	Article						Geochemistry; Stable isotope of water; Sulfate; Geothermometry; Methana; Loutraki; Greece	OXYGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; AEGEAN ARC; SYSTEM; WATER; ORIGIN; FRACTIONATION; SULPHATES; EXCHANGE; SEAWATER; ISLAND	A geochemical survey on the thermal fluids released by the volcanic/geothermal system of Methana Peninsula and Loutraki area was undertaken. The Loutraki area is found in the southern part of Athens and the Methana volcano in the north-eastern part of Peloponnesus, which is characterized by high salinity waters. Chemical and isotopic contents were used for the investigation of the origin of thermal water, for the estimation of the mixing process between meteoric, magmatic and sea water involved in the deep geothermal systems and for the evaluation of the deep aquifer temperature. The chemical and isotopic data of the thermal Cl-rich water springs of Methana suggest that they are fed by thermal water mixed with local groundwater and seawater respectively. The parent hydrothermal liquid is a mixture of local groundwater (similar to 43%), seawater (similar to 34%) and arc-type magmatic water (similar to 23%). The chemical and isotopic data of the thermal HCO(3)-rich water springs of Loutraki samples indicate a purely meteoric origin. Assessments from chemical and isotopic geothermometer applied on the thermal waters springs suggest the probable existence of a deep geothermal reservoir of middle enthalpy (150 degrees C) a Methana and low enthalpy (80 C) in Loutraki area. However, the contribution of marine solutions to the geothermal fluids of Methana and Loutraki area is one of the main cases for the disturbance of the chemical and isotopic geothermometers rendering these calculated temperatures questionable.

The thermal fluids of the Kolyuchino-Mechigmen Zone (KMZ) show specific characteristics. The zone corresponds to recent depression with occurrences of basic volcanism and high seismicity. Characteristic features of the gases in the springs of the KMZ include the predominance of carbon dioxide, high percentage of mantle-derived helium, enrichment of CO2 in C-13, admixture of nonatmospheric nitrogen, excess in Ar-40 and N-15 relative to the atmosphere, maximal depletion of thermal water in deuterium and heavy oxygen isotope, and the highest estimates of deep temperature in reservoirs of hydrothermal fluid. All these features indicate the contemporary ascent of a mantle diapir that supplied helium enriched in He-3 and thermal energy to the crust, thus provoking thermal metamorphism of rocks and degradation of permafrost.

J	Laist, DW; Reynolds, JE				Laist, DW; Reynolds, JE			Influence of power plants and other warm-water refuges on Florida manatees	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Florida manatees; Trichechus manatus latirostris; habitat protection; warm-water refuges; Florida springs; power plants; zooarcheology; conservation; risk assessment	TRICHECHUS-MANATUS; HUMPBACK-WHALES; PATTERNS	Because of limited tolerance to cold, most Florida manatees survive cold winter periods by aggregating at warm-water discharges from power plants and natural springs in central and northern Florida. Many power plants used by manatees may soon be retired. When this occurs, some people assume manatees will move to warmer areas in southern Florida; others fear they will stay near retired plants and sustain high levels of cold-related deaths causing a decline in abundance. To assess these possibilities, we examine warm-water habitats, population structure and movement, cold-related deaths, and information on possible historical manatee distribution. Winter water temperatures even in southernmost Florida periodically fall below manatee tolerance levels. To survive such periods, manatees use two types of warm-water refuges: warm-water discharges, and passive thermal basins that cool slowly, thereby temporarily retaining warm temperatures. During the coldest periods, perhaps 60% of all manatees use 10 power plants and 15% use four natural springs; most others use thermal basins in southern Florida. Site fidelity to these refuges appears to be the principal factor segregating manatees into at least four subpopulations. Since 1986, rates of cold-related deaths in southernmost Florida (10.0%) have exceeded those in areas with natural springs in central and northern Florida (8.8%). Our findings suggest that warm-water springs in northern Florida offer better winter habitat than thermal basins in southern Florida and are better able to support large numbers of manatees. Although evidence is scant, we suggest that manatees historically over-wintered principally at northern springs, but that Pre-Columbian and European hunting restricted their winter range to southernmost Florida by the early 1900s. We also suggest that southernmost Florida may not be able to sustain a large influx of displaced of manatees in the absence of power plants, and that warm-water springs in northern Florida should be considered the most important source of natural warm-water habitat.

Discharge of the springs is 50-12001 per minute with the surface temperature from 40 to 94 degreesC. Environmental isotopes and chemical concentrations have been used to investigate the origin and subsurface history of thermal water. Four sets of water samples were collected and analyzed for various isotopes including O-18, H-2 and H-3 of water; S-34 and O-18 of dissolved sulphates and chemical contents. Isotopic and chemical data show that the origin of thermal water is meteoric water. On the delta -diagram, delta O-18 and delta H-2 data plotting below the local meteoric water line with a slope around 12.3 show that the original thermal water receives recharge from precipitation at higher altitude (3000m) and undergoes delta O-18 shift of about 1% due to exchange with rocks. Different correlations between isotopes, temperature and Cl indicate that the observed isotopic compositions have evolved due to mixing of different proportions of shallow water at different spring paths during movement of thermal water towards the surface. It is also inferred from the tritium data along with delta O-18 and delta H-2 that the circulation time is long and is estimated to be more than 50 years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study measured the concentration of major ions in water from the Hongshuilantang Hot Spring in 2017 and 2020. The ion composition was classified by hydrochemistry into the HCO3 center dot SO4-Na chemical type. The composition of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the Hongshuilantang Hot Spring were located near the global meteoric water line (GMWL), indicating that the recharge source of the hot spring was meteoric water. The delta D and delta 18O values were not plotted on the Glogal Meteroric Water Line (GMWL), and there were some deviations, which suggested that hot spring water underwent water-rock interactions. Deep circulation water played an important role during the evolution process of thermal water. Water temperature showed a decreasing trend from October 2013 to June 2015 during the Rushan earthquake swarm in eastern China. Because of the occurrence of the earthquake swarm, we inferred that regional stress in this area began to be released, allowing continuous rebalancing. Free surface water appeared in some aquifers, and the seepage of low-temperature underground water into the upper aquifer led to a drop in water temperature in the hot spring. The Hongshuilantang Hot Spring and the epicenter of the Rushan earthquake swarm were located on the Muping-Jimo seismological fault zone, with the same seismotectonic system and some genesis relationships.

Within the same time interval more than 200 earthquakes with 3.8 <= M <= 5.3 occurred in the area. The data display several anomalies in Cl-, SO42-, delta D and delta(18)O, always immediately after an event, with a relaxation time of 3 - 4 weeks. The responses occurred only to earthquakes with the estimated epicenters very close to the location of a spring. These results indicate that: 1) at least for earthquakes with M < 5.3 within the Guerrero "seismic gap'' there were no precursors in the chemical ( ionic) and isotopic composition of thermal waters ( on a weekly basis); 2) two groups of springs near Acapulco, Dos Arroyos and Paso Real, are sensitive to seismic activity and therefore further monitoring of these springs may help to unravel the mechanisms of the "hydro-seismointeraction'' in the area.

J	Valeriani, F; Gianfranceschi, G; Spica, VR				Valeriani, Federica; Gianfranceschi, Gianluca; Spica, Vincenzo Romano			The microbiota as a candidate biomarker for SPA pools and SPA thermal spring stability after seismic events	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Earthquake; SPA thermal water; Microbial stability; Biodiversity; Hygiene	YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; HOT-SPRINGS; BACTERIAL; COMMUNITIES; ARCHAEAL; SYSTEMS; WATERS; PCR	Worldwide, the location of thermal springs overlaps seismic areas, and the higher occurrence of earthquakes may impact on water stability and safety. The hydrogeological perturbations pose environmental and public health risks that can be monitored by well-established chemical, physical and biological parameters. Specific health concerns involve the exposure of the population to the medical or wellness uses of SPA thermal waters, e.g. in respiratory or hydropinic treatments as well as during rehabilitative or recreational activities in pools. Since SPA waters are characterized by their own microbiota, we analysed by 16S amplicon sequencing the dynamics of water microbial communities after the August 2017 Ischia island earthquake. For the first time, we report the impact of a seismic event on a thermal spring water, whose microbiota was deeply characterized before and immediately after the natural disaster. The biodiversity stability of the water underwent a dramatic disturbance following the earthquake, as summarized by a Shannon index moving from 1.300 during May 2016-July 2017, up to 1.600 during the first 20-70 h after the event and slightly slowing down to 1.500 after 30 days and to 1.400 after 6 months. Microbiota analysis showed a sudden reduction of the relative abundance of autochthone thermophilic species within the first 20 h and a parallel increase of other thermophilic species as well as of ectopic bacteria from soil, sediments, sea, freshwater and wastewaters. Cultivable mesophilic bacteria were observed only in the first 20 h sample (7 x 10(3)/L), even if the presence of faecal contamination traces was detected by Real Time PCR also up to 70 h after the disaster. OTUs analysis of putative metabolic functions showed several changes between pre and post event, such as in the distribution of Sulphur metabolizing and Carbon fixation species. The restoration of the original pattern followed a slow trend, requiring over six months. The observed results confirm the impact of the earthquake on the microbiota structure of the underground thermal spring water, suggesting further perspectives for monitoring water stability and safety issues by a metagenomic approach.

Collecting and measuring the free gas phase will allow for further compositional analysis that may be useful in improving gas-derived parameters such as recharge temperature and age, as well as quantification of methanogenesis and flux of crustal/mantle gasses. By installing a phase separator at the spring discharge, a thermal mass flow sensor is utilized to measure the gas flow rate (ebullition + flux) generated from a spring. The water flow rate is determined by a standard weir. Field performance of the device was tested on a spring discharging from the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer near the town of Connerville in south-central Oklahoma, USA.

Hydrogeology of northern Sierra de Chiapas, Mexico: a conceptual model based on a geochemical characterization of sulfide-rich karst brackish springs	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Springs; Hydrogen sulfide; Karst; Groundwater flow; Mexico	TECOMINOACAN OIL-RESERVOIR; GULF-OF-MEXICO; SULFATE REDUCTION; FORMATION WATER; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; THERMAL SPRINGS; GROUNDWATER; DISSOLUTION; EVOLUTION	Conspicuous sulfide-rich karst springs flow from Cretaceous carbonates in northern Sierra de Chiapas, Mexico. This is a geologically complex, tropical karst area. The physical, geologic, hydrologic and chemical attributes of these springs were determined and integrated into a conceptual hydrogeologic model. A meteoric source and a recharge elevation below 1,500 m are estimated from the spring-water isotopic signature regardless of their chemical composition. Brackish spring water flows at a maximum depth of 2,000 m, as inferred from similar chemical attributes to the produced water from a nearby oil well. Oil reservoirs may be found at depths below 2,000 m. Three subsurface environments or aquifers are identified based on the B, Li+, K+ and SiO2 concentrations, spring water temperatures, and CO2 pressures. There is mixing between these aquifers. The aquifer designated Local is shallow and contains potable water vulnerable to pollution. The aquifer named Northern receives some brackish produced water. The composition of the Southern aquifer is influenced by halite dissolution enhanced at fault detachment surfaces. Epigenic speleogenesis is associated with the Local springs. In contrast, hypogenic speleogenesis is associated with the brackish sulfidic springs from the Northern and the Southern environments.

The graphical relations between concentrations of the uranium and radium isotopes in thermal waters and their parameters such as temperature and mineralization were drawn up and discussed. The relation between the contents of Ra-226 and Ra-228 for the investigated waters was also analysed. The relations show that the influence of temperature on the mineralization and radioactive elements in thermal waters is complicated.

The online available dataset of the Campania Environmental Agency (ARPAC) was analysed via spatial, temporal and statistical analyses to assess the impact of climate variability on 118 springs, monitored over the period from 2002 to 2017. The meteorological dataset was used to compute average annual precipitation and atmospheric temperatures. Spring water temperatures, electrical conductivity, pH, chloride and fluoride were selected to determine if climate variations had a significant impact on spring water quality. This study shows that the Campania region has experienced an increase of spring water temperatures of approximately 2.0 degrees C during the monitored period. This is well-linked with the increase of atmospheric minimum temperatures, but not with average and maximum atmospheric temperatures. The spring water temperature increases were not reflected by a concomitant change of the analysed water quality parameters. The latter were linked to the precipitation trend and other local factors, like spring altitude and the presence of geothermal heat fluxes.

The Xianshuihe fault zone (XSHF) is considered one of the most active seismic fault zones in China; 43 hot springs were sampled and analysed in the laboratory for major elements, silica, stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) and strontium isotopes were investigated from 2008 to 2021. The meteoric water acted as the primary water source of the hot spring in the XSHF, and recharged elevations ranged from 1.9 to 4.8 km. The geothermometers method was used to estimate the region of thermal storage temperature and its temperature between 8 and 142 degrees C. And the circulation depth ranged from 0.1 to 6.9 km. Most of the hot spring water was immature water with a weak degree of water-rock reaction. However, the degree of water-rock reaction and the depth of hot spring water circulation were high in part of the Kangding and Daufu segments, which also had the highest reservoir temperature and the most frequent strong earthquakes. Temporal variations of hydrogeochemical showed that Na+, Cl- and SO42- decreased obviously following the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 and existed abnormal value fluctuations from the 20 April 2013 Lushan Ms7.0 to 22 November 2014 Kangding Ms6.3 occurred and after 20 July 2017 returned to the normal levels. And the ion concentrations in hot springs increased by 5% to 35% three months before 22 November 2014 Kangding Ms6.3 with the obvious precursor anomaly. Hydrogeochemical anomalies could be useful for predicting an earthquake in the study area.

Turkey has numerous thermal sources that have been used to cure a number of common diseases. Among these thermal sources, Kangal Fish Spring has a unique nature with its doctor fish known to cure psoriasis. To date, a number of studies analyzed Kangal Fish Spring as a thermal source with its water and fish characteristics but no research to the authors' knowledge has been conducted to analyze the spring's demand and destination characteristics. In Turkey, research about thermal health centers and their visitors, is fairly limited from a tourism experience point of view. The current paper reports a case study of psoriasis treatment by doctor fish in Kangal Fish Spring as part of health tourism in Turkey. The paper describes Kangal Fish Spring as a health tourism destination and investigates socio-economic and visitor characteristics of the people visiting Kangal Fish Spring. As part of the study, 104 visitors to the destination were surveyed and visitor perceptions about the destination and visitor characteristics were reported. The paper concludes with a discussion about the future of the destination and health tourism in Turkey. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study area lies over the Sone, Narmada, and Tapti lineament of Precambrian Chotanagpur Gneissic Complex. Water chemistry has been carried out based on reaction stoichiometry and geo-statistical tools to identify geochemical process. Piper and Gibbs diagram suggest that the spring water belongs to Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3 (-) + CO3 (2-) water type and are controlled by rock dominance. Dissolution and precipitation of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, and fluorite minerals were identified as principle source of major ions in seven geothermal spring water. Principle component analyses revealed that major ions of spring water are derived from geogenic processes such as weathering, dissolution, and precipitation of various minerals. Overall results suggest that major ions of the spring's water are derived from natural origin because no evidence of anthropogenic sources was observed during the study period. This study has also revealed that water quality of spring's water is not suitable for drinking purposes and quite suitable for irrigation because of high abundance of Na+, K+, Cl-, and HCO3 (-) ions.

Environmental factors structuring diatom assemblages in thermo-mineral springs of Sardinia, Italy	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						extreme environments; springs; environmental gradients; eukaryotic algae; Bacillariophyceae; Mediterranean area; biodiversity	HOT-SPRINGS; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; GEOTHERMAL DIATOMS; LIMPOPO PROVINCE; GREEN-ALGAE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; BACILLARIOPHYCEAE; RECOMMENDATIONS; INDICATORS	Thermal springs provide natural laboratories to test the responses of biological communities to various stressors. To date, little is known about how water temperature and chemistry influence the microalgal assemblages in these ecosystems, especially in the circum-Mediterranean area. In this study, we assessed the environmental drivers of benthic diatom assemblages collected from different substrates in 8 thermo-mineral springs of Sardinia, Italy, with a focus on temperature and conductivity. A total of 205 diatom species (67 genera) were found, of which 12 (8 genera) were centric and 193 (59 genera) were pennate. Composition of diatom assemblages was associated with temperature, pH, conductivity, bicarbonates (HCO3-), and sulfates (SO42-). Multivariate analyses also confirmed differences in species composition, richness, diversity, and evenness of diatom assemblages from groups of springs distinguished by temperature and conductivity gradients. We found higher species richness, diversity, and evenness in hyperthermal (water temperature = 52.7-71.5 degrees C) and medium-mineral springs (conductivity = 590-1193 mu S/cm). Our results indicate that thermal springs are not always inhospitable environments for diatoms. Springs with high water temperatures hosted rich and diverse diatom assemblages, likely thanks to their ecotonal nature and a combination of multiple local factors.

The experiment was performed on a loamy soil (Gleyic luvisol) in northern France during the establishment of sugar beet in spring 1992. Temperature, water content, heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the ploughed layer, surface albedo and roughness, net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and evaporation were all measured over a spring-tilled soil, an autumn-tilled soil and a compacted soil. Differences in soil heat fluxes were related to soil evaporation and thermal conductivity. Differences in soil temperatures were related to heat capacity. In spite of a considerable evaporation, the compacted soil had the highest soil heat flux because of its high thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the spring-tilled soil was the warmest because of its low heat capacity, and sugar beet germinated more rapidly with spring soil tillage. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

Reassessment of taxonomic diversity of Cyanobacteria in microbial mats and physicochemical characteristics of Badrinath thermal spring, Garhwal Himalaya, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Anthropogenic activities; Badrinath thermal spring; thermophilic Cyanobacteria; microbial mat	HOT-SPRINGS; UTTARANCHAL HIMALAYA; SOIL	In view of the earlier studies on the composition of cyanobacteria of Badrinath thermal spring, carried out during 1965 and 1968, the present study is a revisit to evaluate the changes in these cyanobacterial mats that occurred over a period of about 40 years. The physicochemical characteristics of the site were also estimated. The present study revealed the local absence of certain genera (Synechococcus, Microchaete, and Calothrix) over the period and succession by others (Microcystis, Aphanocapsa, Gloeocapsa, Xenococcus, Anabaena and Fischerella). The authors report that the eutrophic nature of Badrinath thermal water is primarily responsible for the rich taxonomic diversity of cyanobacteria in microbial mats. Besides, the decrase in temperature from 60 degrees C to 52 degrees C and in pH from 9.0 to 7.92 of thermal water, during the last 40 years are likely to be the most important factors attributing towards the changes in the composition of the cyanobacterial mats. The anthropogenic or geological activities might have contributed towards the changes that occurred at the study site.	[Bhardwaj, Kailash N.; Kainthola, Anup; Tiwari, S.

Assessment of mixing between shallow and thermal waters using geochemical and environmental isotope tracers (N Portugal): a review and reinterpretation	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Thermal waters; Shallow groundwaters; Environmental isotopes; Geochemistry; Mixing processes; N Portugal	SYSTEM; AREA	Caldas de Moledo thermal (27-46 A degrees C) spring and borehole waters issue in the region of the famous Port Wine vineyards, in the Douro River valley (Northern Portugal). The most abundant lithotypes are lower Cambrian metasedimentary rocks, Variscan granitoids and aplite-pegmatitic veins. The thermal waters are characterised by pH a parts per thousand 9.0, TDS ranging from 200 to 350 mg/L, and belong to the HCO3-Na facies indicating that the reservoir rock should be mainly granite. Since the local Spa is strongly dependent on water quality, the effects of mixing between local shallow cold groundwaters and deep thermal waters have been properly investigated. In the SO4 (2-) (mg/L) versus delta O-18 (aEuro degrees vs. V-SMOW) diagram we can observe that some of the thermal springs show evidences of mixing (higher SO4 (2-) concentrations) with local meteoric waters infiltrated at lower altitude sites (enriched delta O-18 signatures), showing the "altitude effect" in the isotopic composition of the recharge waters. Similar trends can be found in the K+, NO3 (-), Ca2+ and Na+ (mg/L) versus delta O-18 (aEuro degrees vs. V-SMOW) diagrams. It should be stated that SO4 (2-), K+ and Ca2+ are present in the fertilizers and fungicides used in the vineyards in the northern part of the country. Up to now, the thermal waters from boreholes used in the local Spa do not show evidences of mixing with shallow groundwaters contaminated with agrochemicals. The results obtained so far indicate that in the near future, special attention should be put on the possible occurrence of diffuse agricultural contamination (related to the Port Wine vineyards) in the thermal spring waters.

A total of 19 springs from two important river basins of southern Kerala such as Ithikkara and Kallada river basins were studied for 18 physico-chemical (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness (TH), Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, SiO2, Fe2+, and F-) as well as bacteriological parameters. The discharge computations show that free-falling type of springs in the area discharge about 256.23 million liters of water a year. A comparative study between the spring water samples of highland and lowland regions reveal that the quality of spring water, except pH and bacteriological contents, satisfies the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards andWorld Health Organization for drinking water. Spring water samples collected from the lowlands register high value of Na+ and Cl- compared with the highlands. Bicarbonate, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ values are high in highland than lowland springs. The present study reveals that the spring water sources in the region can be developed as an alternate source for drinking water, provided pH correction and proper disinfection are done prior to its end use.

Elucidating sources to aridland Dalhousie Springs in the Great Artesian Basin (Australia) to inform conservation	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Australia; Groundwater management; Spring source assessment; Thermal modeling; Groundwater protection	EYRE SOUTH REGION; HEAT-FLOW; WATER; DEPOSITS; OIL	Dalhousie Springs is the largest spring complex in the western Great Artesian Basin (GAB), Australia. Aridland springs like Dalhousie provide the only aquatic habitats in regions lacking surface water and are globally threatened by unsustainable groundwater development. Groundwater use in the more densely populated eastern GAB historically was higher than that in the western GAB, where groundwater is primarily used for ranching; however, economically important mineral and energy industries have increased groundwater use. Throughout the western GAB, groundwater development has reduced spring discharge and artesian head. Of concern are potential impacts on spring discharge from future pumping; thus, an understanding of groundwater sources to springs is needed to develop effective groundwater management strategies that maintain spring flow. The generally accepted hydrogeologic model suggests Dalhousie Springs discharge is entirely composed of Jurassic-Cretaceous aquifer contributions; however, this study improves understanding of Dalhousie Springs by integrating new hydrogeologic and hydrochemical data with historic, previously unpublished petroleum exploration well-test data. A thermal model is used to estimate potential aquifer source depths of 270-802 m. Sr-87/Sr-86 > 0.715 suggests water-rock interaction with radiogenic basement and the importance of faults for vertical fluid transfer across multiple aquifers. Results show that Dalhousie Springs discharge is sourced by the previously unreported Permian Crown Point Formation and the Jurassic-Cretaceous aquifer. Mitigating effects of future groundwater development on Dalhousie Springs requires managing groundwater from Jurassic-Cretaceous and Permian aquifers to preserve near-spring potentiometric surfaces. Expanded multiple-environmental-tracer monitoring could be used to further refine groundwater sources to Dalhousie Springs.

The major outflow point of the waters of the cave system is the Boltiv spring, which feeds the artificial Malom Lake. Previous radon measurements in the cave system and in the spring established the highest radon concentration (71 BqL(-1)) in the springwater. According to previous studies, the origin of radon was identified as iron-hydroxide containing biofilms, which form where there is mixing of cold and thermal waters, and these biofilms efficiently adsorb radium from the thermal water component. Since mixing of waters is responsible for the formation of the cave as well, these iron-hydroxide containing biofilms and the consequent high radon concentrations mark the active cave forming zones. Based on previous radon measurements, it is supposed that the active mixing and cave forming zone has to be close to the spring, since the highest radon concentration was measured there. Therefore radon mapping was carried out with the help of divers in order to get a spatial distribution of radon in the cave passages closest to the spring. Based on our measurements, the highest radon activity concentration (84 BqL(-1)) was found in the springwater. Based on the distribution of radon activity concentrations, direct connection was established between the spring and the Istvan-room of the cave, which was verified by an artificial tracer. However, the distribution of radon in the cave passages shows lower concentrations (18-46 BqL(-1)) compared to the spring, therefore an additional deep inflow from hitherto unknown cave passages is assumed, from which waters with high radon content arrive to the spring. These passages are assumed to be in the active cave formation zone. This study proved that radon activity concentration distribution is a useful tool in underwater cave exploration.

Tentative age dating of the travertine mound indicates growth initiated with onset of the late Holocene shift to more humid and cool climate conditions and suggests that the flow of thermal waters was limited during the Hypsithermal, which in turn places constraints on the evolutionary biology of endemic species in the spring system. Two large caves and one collapsed cave structure are developed within the deposit. Cave development is in response to both physical erosion of till underlying the travertine and acid gas attack of calcite that makes up the deposit. This process is buffered by formation of reaction crusts of gypsum on the interior cave walls. Only minor modern travertine growth occurs due to historic flow control measures. Understanding the flow of water through the historic site is critical for long-term preservation.

The performance of these geothermometers in predicting the reservoir temperatures has been evaluated by applying a geochemometrics (geochemical and statistical) method. The springs of the LPGF are of bicarbonate type and the majority have attained partial-equilibrium chemical conditions and the remaining have shown non-equilibrium conditions. In the case of geothermal wells, water is dominantly of chloride-type and, among the studied eight geothermal wells, four have shown full-equilibrium chemical conditions and another four have indicated partial-equilibrium conditions. All springs of HCO3- type water have provided unreliable reservoir temperatures, whereas the only one available spring of SO42- type water has provided the reservoir temperature nearer to the average BHT of the wells. Contrary to the general expected behavior, spring water of non-equilibrium and geothermal well water of partial-equilibrium chemical conditions have indicated more reliable reservoir temperatures than those of partially-equilibrated and fully-equilibrated water, respectively. Among the chemical concentration data, Li and SiO2 of two springs, SO42- and Mg of four springs, and HCO3 and Na concentrations of two geothermal wells were identified as outliers and this has been reflected in very low reservoir temperatures predicted by the geothermometers associated with them (Li-Mg, Na-Li, Na-K-Mg, SiO2 etc.). Identification of the outlier data points may be useful in differentiating the chemical characteristics, lithology and the physico-chemical and geological processes at the sample locations of the study area. In general, the solute geothermometry of the spring waters of LPGF indicated a dominantly (94%) of underestimated deep reservoir temperatures, whereas in the case of the geothermal wells, many temperatures (54%) are underestimated, some are (43%) overestimated and a very small number (3%) are similar to an average bottom-hole temperatures (BHT) of the wells. 28 out of the total applied 29 geothermometers for spring waters have predicted the deep reservoir temperatures that are characterized by statistically significant large differences compared to the average BHTs of the geothermal wells. In the case of waters of the geothermal wells, 23 out of the total applied 28 geothermometers have predicted the reservoir temperatures similar (statistically no significant differences) to the BHTs of the corresponding geothermal wells.

Temperature was monitored and brook charr sampled for vital statistics from late May through September using fyke nets and weirs at four locations within a 25.8 km section of stream. Scale analysis was used to determine captured brook charr age, past length at age and relative annual growth rates. Late spring and summer water temperature patterns varied between years with the greatest variability occurring in May and June. Age and size structure also varied between years and was significantly related to temperature. Years with cooler late spring and summer temperature patterns were dominated by older (age 2 and 3), larger brook charr, while years with warmer spring and summer temperature patterns were dominated by younger (age 1), smaller brook charr. Spring and summer temperature did not appear to have a significant effect on the growth of age 0 or age 1 brook charr. However, temperature was negatively related to brook charr growth from age 2 on. As spring and summer water temperatures are critical to brook charr growth and survival, it is important that a streams thermal regime be considered when establishing management goals for this species.

NOV.; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; CAVE; LAKE; EPSILONPROTEOBACTERIA; RECLASSIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; GRADIENT	The discharging zones of thermal karst caves provide special environmental conditions for bacteria involved in the biogeochemical processes. The taxonomic composition of bacterial communities inhabiting these still active natural habitats is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal and compare the bacterial diversity of upwelling thermal waters, rock surface biofilms, and cave deposits using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Two thermal karst caves formed in carbonate rocks and located at the discharging endpoints of the Transdanubian Range (Hungary) were studied: a sublacustrine spring cave and a phreatic hypogene cave. The results of 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing revealed that almost all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria and/or Epsilonbacteraeota. Other abundant phyla showed habitat-dependent and diverse distributions. Sequences of the thermal waters were mainly associated with different chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (genera Thiovirga, Thiofaba, and Arcobacter in the sublacustrine thermal spring cave, whereas genera Sulfurovum, Sulfuricurvum, and Sulfurifustis were characteristic of the phreatic hypogene thermal cave) in accordance with the difference in environmental parameters. Sequences belonging to ammonia-oxidizing (unclassified Nitrosococcaceae) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) were characteristic of the hypogene cave. Sequences related to photoautotrophic bacteria from the lake water and chemoheterotrophic bacteria from the sediment were only found in the sublacustrine spring cave samples.

ETNA; MEXICO	Tacana hosts an active volcano-hydrothermal system, characterized by boiling temperature fumaroles, near the summit (3,600-3,800 m asl), and bubbling degassing thermal springs near its base (1,000-2,000 m asl). The magmatic signature of gases rising to the surface is attested by their high CO2 contents (delta C-13(CO2) = -3.6 +/- 1.3 %), and relatively high He-3/He-4 ratios (6.0 +/- 0.9 R-A), with a CO2/He-3 ratio typical for the Central American Arc (2.3 x 10(10) -6.9 x 10(11)). Such magmatic signature is practically identical for the near-summit fumaroles, and the bubbling gases at the base of Tacana edifice. Besides the HCO3-enrichment in thermal spring waters, the springs (pH 5.8-6.7) show a SO4-and minor Cl-enrichment: a CO2 and H2S + SO2-rich magmatic steam condenses into a deeper geothermal aquifer, and the resulting hydrothermal fluid mixes with meteoric waters near the surface. The recharge area for the thermal springs is located at higher elevations (> 400 m higher than spring outlet elevation), as inferred from the delta D-delta O-18 data for rivers, thermal and cold springs. These general insights of the Tacana volcano-hydrothermal system serve as the baseline for future volcanic surveillance, and geothermal prospection. The main locus of hydrothermal activity is located inside the Tacana horseshoe-shaped crater in the northwestern sector of the volcanic edifice. In terms of volcanic hazard, this sector can be considered the most probable site for future phreatic activity.

Nowadays, efforts are made from the Hellenic Republic to modernize the existing facilities and infrastructure networks of the area. To study the complex ecosystem of the thermal spring, we collected water from four sampling points (Lake, and Caves 1, 2, and 3). Filtration method was used for microbial enumeration. In parallel, total bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 166 different bacterial families were detected. Differences in families, genera, and species abundances were detected between the different sampling points. Specifically, Comamonadaceae was the most common family detected in Lake and Cave 3. Similarly, in Caves 1 and 2, Rhodobacteraceae was detected at a higher percentage compared to the rest of the families. Moreover, the detection of sequences assigned to waterborne or opportunistic pathogens, i.e., Enterobacteriaceae, Legionellaceae, Coxiellaceae, and Clostridiaceae, as well as Enterococcus and Vibrio, is of great importance. Although the presence of pathogens was not examined by quantitative PCR, the detection of their sequences strengthens the need of the planned rehabilitation actions of this natural environment in order to allow human swimming.

In the flood-ebb tidal cycles, the bottom temperature decreases (increases) during flood (ebb) tides, which are dominated by the tidal-current induced horizontal advection. The ebb tide-induced temperature increase is larger than the flood tide-induced temperature decrease due to seasonal warming. In the spring-neap tidal cycles, the temperature and the vertical temperature structure show notable fortnightly variation from 16 July to 25 August. The bottom temperature increases from neap to spring tides and decreases from spring to neap. The Richardson number demonstrates strengthened vertical mixing during spring tides but enhanced stratification during neap tides. The spring-neap variation in vertical shear caused by tidal current is the dominant factor that induces the fortnightly variation in vertical mixing and thus bottom temperature.

Water Management for Conservation and Ecosystem Function: Modeling the Prioritization of Source Water in a Working Landscape	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							FISH HABITAT; RIVERS; TEMPERATURE; FLOW; RESTORATION; STREAMS; SALMON	Conservation in working landscapes is an important aspect of stream restoration. Landowners with agricultural water rights are increasingly adding instream flow as a beneficial use of their allocated water. However, stream restoration projects commonly focus on the quantity of water dedicated to the environment and overlook water quality. For cold-water ecosystems, the preservation of natural thermal regimes is a key to conservation efforts in the face of a changing climate. This study explored the effects of increasing stream flow using alternative water sources (e.g., instream runoff versus offchannel springs) to enhance cold-water stream habitat on a working cattle ranch. Using empirical data to create a steady-state stream flow and water temperature model, we evaluated temperature benefits and management trade-offs for ecological and agricultural water use. The modeled results showed that the source of water and the method used to deliver water to the channel affected the quality and extent of cold-water habitat. Offchannel spring water cooled 7-day average maximum temperatures and 7-day average mean temperatures by as much as 3.7? and 2.9?, respectively, but only when potential offchannel aquatic habitat was sacrificed for mainstem habitat. When offchannel, spring-fed habitat was provided, the value of spring water to the main channel decreased. Our findings suggest that source water thermal quality is of paramount importance for enhancing ecosystem function and improving cold-water habitat in working landscapes. In addition, the restoration of a historic spring channel may provide added ecosystem benefits by enhancing aquatic habitat for cold-water species.	[Lukk, Amber K. K.; Lusardi, Robert A.

More than 250 thermal water samples were collected on a regular basis from November 2006 to January 2009 to measure element concentrations as a monitor of earthquake precursors. Water samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The B, Ba, Br, and Ge concentrations were monitored for three years and ranged from 6822-7666, 64-101, 271-406, and 4.1-6.0 mu g L-1, respectively. The chloride concentrations for this period were in the 89-127 mg L-1 range. The data identify some element anomalies at least two hours prior to a major earthquake and for some time afterwards. These anomalies are characterized by decreases up to 20% in B, Ba, Cl, and Ge concentrations and can be attributed to stress-/strain-induced pressure changes in the subsurface water systems. From this study, it can be suggested that thermal springs in a fault line area are ideal sites for monitoring precursors to earthquakes.

Thermal springs and drilled wells are located in the Eynal, Citgol and Nasa locations, which are part of the Simav geothermal field. Studies were carried out to obtain the main chemical and physical characteristics of thermal waters. These waters are used for heating of residences and greenhouses and for balneological purposes. Bottom temperatures of the drilled wells reach 163degreesC with total dissolved solids around 2225 mg/kg. Surface temperatures of thermal springs vary between 51degreesC and 90degreesC. All the thermal waters belong to Na-HCO3-SO4 facies. The cold groundwaters are Ca-Mg-HCO3 type. Dissolution of host rock and ion-exchange reactions in the reservoir of the geothermal system shift the Ca-Mg-HCO3 type cold groundwaters to the Na-HCO3-SO4 type thermal waters. Thermal waters are oversaturated at discharge temperatures for aragonite, calcite, quartz, chalcedony, magnesite and dolomite minerals giving rise to a carbonate-rich scale. Gypsum and anhydrite minerals are undersaturated with all of the thermal waters. Boiling during ascent of the thermal fluids produces steam and liquid waters resulting in an increase of the concentrations of the constituents in discharge waters. Steam fraction, y, of the thermal waters of which temperatures are above 100degreesC is between 0.075 and 0.119. Reservoir pH is much lower than pH measured in the liquid phase separated at atmospheric conditions, since the latter experienced heavy loss of acid gases, mainly CO2. Assessment of the various empirical chemical geothermometers and geochemical modelling suggest that reservoir temperatures vary between 175degreesC and 200degreesC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Pasvanoglu, S; Celik, M				Pasvanoglu, Suzan; Celik, Mehmet			Hydrogeochemical characteristics and conceptual model of camlidere low temperature geothermal prospect, northern Central Anatolia	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Thermal waters; Advective flow; Hydrogeochemistry; Hydrothermal model; Central Anatolia; Turkey	THERMAL WATERS; GEOCHEMISTRY; VOLCANISM; TURKEY; EQUILIBRIA; PROVINCE; AREA; EAST	The Camlidere prospect is located about 100 km NW of Ankara in northern Central Anatolia. Thermal springs discharge in volcanic terrain, often in clusters, along faults in 5 separate areas. The spring discharge temperatures are between 11 and 28 degrees C. Artesian flow of 4 wells (depths ranging from 100 to 1367 m) discharges Na-HCO3 and Ca-Na-HCO3 type thermal waters with temperatures changing between 27 and 42 degrees C. Cold springs at the fringe of the field are of Ca-HCO3 type. Constituents of minor elements (F, B, Fe, Ba, Rb, Cs, As and Sr) are incorporated in the thermal waters during deep water-rock interactions. Saturation indices indicate that mineralisation of the thermal waters involves dissolution of silicates, carbonates and ion exchange reactions. Mixing with surface waters and shallow groundwaters in the discharge areas modifies the geochemical character of the thermal waters. Isotopic data of Camlidere thermal waters (delta O-18, delta H-2, H-3) reflect their deep-circulating meteoric origin and indicate recharge areas between 1494 and 1833 m a.s.l. Such levels are supported by structural data and suggest that Camlidere thermal waters are recharged from the Aluc Mt. in the east and the Mahya Mt. to the west of Camlidere. Isotopic values also indicate a common recharge area (elevation) for deep groundwaters, but suggest different pathlengths required to account for variations in conductivity. Chemical geothermometry (K-Mg, quartz), alteration mineral assembleges and lack of delta O-18 enrichment indicate reservoir temperatures between 100 to-150 degrees C for the Camlidere area. The observed SiO2 values and inferred T(K-Mg) data indicate some advective (terrain controlled) shallow flows involving SiO2 re-equilibration of mixed thermal fluids. Long circulation time of meteoric waters within the basement rocks is also indicated by low tritium values of the thermal and mineral bicarbonate waters, although thermal waters do not achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. The Camlidere prospect hosts a low temperature, fracture-zone system with limited convective up-flow and dominant conductive heat transfer from a resource base in the upper crust to the surface. Based on acquired data, a conceptual model of the geothermal system of Camlidere is proposed.

J	Lee, SG; Kim, TK; Lee, TJ				Lee, Seung-Gu; Kim, Tong-Kwon; Lee, Tae Jong			Strontium isotope geochemistry and its geochemical implication from hot spring waters in South Korea	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article							GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; THERMAL WATERS; GROUNDWATER; EVOLUTION; SR; ORIGIN; RATIOS; BASIN; MAGMATISM; ELEMENTS	Despite being a non-volcanic area, the southern Korean Peninsula has a number of hot water springs with temperatures more than 40 degrees C, most of which are commercially used for spa. The hot springs are located at the fringes of the granite body rather than the center of the Mesozoic granite. Here we report on the geochemical characteristics of the hot water springs. The hot springs in the Jurassic granite area are mainly of Na(-Ca) - HCO3 type, whereas those in the Cretaceous granite area are of Na - Cl (-SO4) type. The stable isotope composition of O and H suggests a meteoric origin of the hot spring water. Further, the chemical components of the hot spring waters indicate that they were all derived from hot spring water-rock interaction rather than through anthropogenic input. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the hot spring waters in the Jurassic granite area ranges from 0.711088 to 0.729034 and that in the Cretaceous granite area ranges from 0.705652 to 0.707912. Such Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio distribution of hot spring waters corresponds with the distribution of the initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for the emplacement age of the Jurassic and Cretaceous granites in the hot spring occurrence area. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the hot spring waters were also divided into three groups according to their geographical location: eastern, western, and southern groups. The constant Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of hot spring water from one hot spring area during the last 6 years strongly suggests that the hot-spring-bearing aquifer system in South Korea should be separated from the upper cold shallow groundwater system. This indicates that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the hot spring waters in the granite area of South Korea originates from an equilibrium because of long-term water-rock interaction rather than short-term water-rock interaction due to the input of recent meteoric water. Hence, it may be concluded that hot spring water in the granite area may be a limited deep groundwater resource that might deplete with overuse. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the chemical characteristics of the thermal waters are investigated to identify the main geochemical processes affecting the composition of thermal waters during its ascent toward the surface as well as to determine the subsurface temperature of the feeding reservoir. The thermal waters are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 type with moderate silica and TDS concentrations. Mineral saturation states calculated from PHREEQC geochemical code indicate that thermal waters are supersaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, aragonite, chalcedony, quartz (SI[ 0), and undersaturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite, and amorphous silica (SI < 0). XRD study of the spring deposit samples fairly corroborates the predicted mineral saturation state of the thermal waters. Stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) data confirm the meteoric origin of the thermal waters with no oxygen-18 shift. The mixing phenomenon between thermal water with shallow ground water is substantiated using tritium (H-3) and chemical data. The extent of dilution is quantified using tritium content of thermal springs and non-thermal waters. Classical geothermometers, mixing model, and multicomponent fluid geothermometry modeling (GeoT) have been applied to estimate the subsurface reservoir temperature. Among different classical geothermometers, only quartz geothermometer provide somewhat reliable estimation (96-140 degrees C) of the reservoir temperature. GeoT modeling results suggest that thermal waters have attained simultaneous equilibrium with respect to minerals like calcite, quartz, chalcedony, brucite, tridymite, cristobalite, talc, at the temperature 130 +/- 5 degrees C which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the mixing model.

These faults provide a high-permeability flow path that allows for deep circulation of meteoric water. The depth of circulation, and thus temperature, is largely influenced by fault plane geometry. Calculated circulation depths of up to 4.8 km are consistent with models for hydrothermal ore deposits that invoke the mixing of mineralizing fluids with sulphur-rich meteoric water at depth. Mass-flux calculations indicate that a relatively small spring (5 L/s) can transport large amounts of bacterially reduced sulphur to ore-forming depths over a short geological time scale and can easily account for the sulphur associated with Pb-Zn deposits in the southern Canadian Cordillera. Modern thermal springs may be good analogies for the upper-crustal flow systems in hydrothermal ore deposit models.

In this paper, the diffuser multi-objective control problem of STEC plant is described. Based on the step test, the nonlinear separation model of working fluid dryness and pressure difference between turbine inlet and outlet for STEC plant has been identified. According to the concept of back-off and based on the nonlinear programming, a multi-objective coordination algorithm using the information of process static constraints is proposed. Using the nonlinear separation control method, a solution for STEC diffuser multi-objective control has been proposed. The application results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Major ion, silica, boron, O-18, H-2 and H-3 analysis was conducted on samples taken from the system to determine the origin, circulation, relationship with shallow subsurface water, the recharge and discharge mechanisms, reservoir temperature and the convergence with cold springs in the vicinity. The cold waters are classified as Ca-HCO3 type water, which is typical of shallow subsurface water, while the hot waters are classified as Na-HCO3 type water, which is typical in deep-circulating underground water, as has been confirmed with isotope analysis. The reservoir rocks of the thermal system consist of ophiolite units with secondary porosity along their fracture and crack systems affected by the tectonic activity in the region. Besides serving as a cap to the typical hot water system recharged by meteoric water, the tuff also creates an impermeable barrier to shallow aquifers in the region.

Fluid geochemistry of the Chios geothermal area, Chios Island, Greece	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						hydrogeochemistry; stable isotope of water; sulfate; geothermometry; Chios Island; Greece	OXYGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; NORTHERN GREECE; WATERS; SYSTEMS; HYDROLOGY; SULPHATES; SEAWATER; ORIGIN; PART	Two separate aquifers have been identified in Chios Island. The first one, Nenita, is found in the southern part of the island and the other one, Aghiasmata and Aghia Markela, in the northern part, which is characterized by high salinity waters. Chemical and isotopic contents were used for the investigation of the origin and evolution of thermal water in sedimentary and volcanic rocks, for the estimation of the mixing process between meteoric and seawater involved in the deep geothermal systems and for the evaluation of the deep aquifer temperature. The hot borehole and spring waters discharging in Chios Island, Greece, change in composition from earth-alkaline-bicarbonate-type to alkaline-type chloride. The chemical and physical characteristics of bicarbonate well waters show interaction between meteoric waters and Neocene rocks. In general, for these waters as their mineralization increases the Mg2+ contents increase. The deuterium and oxygen contents of these water samples indicate a meteoric origin. The Na+ and Cl- ions dominate the chemistry of the thermal waters of Aghia Eleni spring. This thermal water appears to be a mixture of seawater and ground water. The marine contribution for this sample is 80-89%. The chemical and isotopic data of the thermal Cl-rich water springs of the northern part of the island, Aghiasmata and Aghia Markela, suggest that they are fed by thermal water mixed with local groundwater and seawater respectively. The parent geothermal liquid is either a mixture mad up of local groundwater (similar to 40%) and arc-type magmatic water (similar to 60%), that did not exchange oxygen isotopes, or a mixture constituted by local groundwater (similar to 70%) and seawater (similar to 30%), which experienced a significant oxygen isotope exchange. Assessments from chemical and isotopic geothermometer applied on the thermal waters springs suggest the probable existence of a deep geothermal reservoir of middle-high enthalpy (220 degrees C) in the northern (Aghiasmata and Aghia Markela) part of the island and low enthalpy (80 degrees C) in the southern part (Nenita-Patrika-Thimiana) of the island.

This study investigated the hydrochemical characteristics of 21 thermal springs in the Simao Basin from 2018 to 2020. In this study period, the 2018 Mojiang M5.9 earthquake caused several hydrochemical changes. The results indicate that the Simao Basin contained saline spring waters, HCO3--rich spring waters, and SO42--rich spring waters. In the study area, the water chemistry types were controlled by stratum lithology. Saline springs flowed through red beds and dissolved large amounts of halite, which is a rich source of Cl(-)and Na+ ions. In the hot spring waters, Ca2+ (Mg2+) and HCO3- were mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals, gypsum, and anhydrite of Triassic rocks. The higher SO42- content in the hot spring waters was caused by the pyrite present in Ailaoshan metamorphic rocks. The reservoir temperatures (121-289 degrees C) in the Simao Basin were estimated by the silica-enthalpy mixing model equation and the silica-enthalpy diagram. The hot springs had higher reservoir temperatures (>250 degrees C) and were mainly located at the edges of the basin. Metamorphic rocks exposed in the region had low permeabilities and these springs was close to nearby deep faults that provided deep heat. In most springs, the concentrations of Ca2+ and HCO3- ions increased obviously before the 2018 Mojiang M5.9 earthquake; however, the concentrations of these ions decreased after the earthquake. The hydrogeochemical variations might be attributed to the vigorous water-rock interactions and the mixing of secondary fluids. The entry of cold shallow groundwater caused changes in the reservoir temperatures of some spring samples.

On some island, hot near-neutral Na-Cl waters can be found discharging in coastal hot springs. Four main different isotopic shifts relative to the local meteoric water line can be observed in the corresponding delta D vs. delta O-18 diagram. For the acid Cl-SO4 waters discharging within thermal fields on volcano slopes, there is a clear mixing trend between meteoric water and volcanic vapor. Steam-heated SO4 waters demonstrate trends indicating kinetic fractionation at temperatures close to the boiling-point. For the coastal springs, the trend is apparently a mixing line between meteoric and seawater.

Deep groundwater flow and geochemical processes in limestone aquifers: evidence from thermal waters in Derbyshire, England, UK	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						England; hydrochemistry; Karst; stable isotopes; thermal conditions	WOO-DALE BOREHOLE; STABLE ISOTOPE; SULFUR; SULFATE; OXYGEN; MINERALIZATION; CATCHMENT; AGE	Thermal waters potentially provide information on geochemical processes acting deep within aquifers. New isotopic data on groundwater sulphate, inorganic carbon and strontium in thermal and non-thermal waters of a major limestone aquifer system in Derbyshire, England, UK, are used to constrain sulphate sources and groundwater evolution. Shallow groundwaters gain sulphate from oxidation of sulphide minerals and have relatively C-13-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Thermal waters have relatively high Sr/Ca and more C-13-enriched DIC as a result of increased water-rock interaction. In other respects, the thermal waters define two distinct groups. Thermal waters rising at Buxton have higher Mg, Mn and Sr-87/Sr-86 and lower Ca and SO4, indicating flow from deep sandstone aquifers via a high permeability pathway in the limestone. By contrast, Matlock-type waters (97% of the thermal flux) have elevated sulphate concentrations derived from interaction with buried evaporites, with no chemical evidence for flow below the limestone. About 5% of the limestone area's groundwater flows to the Matlock group springs via deep regional flow and the remainder flows via local shallow paths to many non-thermal springs. Gypsum dissolution has produced significant tertiary porosity and tertiary permeability in the carbonate aquifer and this is an essential precursor to the development of karstic drainage.

Here, we review the main results reported regarding the effects of Avene TSW on the immune system. In particular, mast cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4(+)T cells have been shown to be modulated by Avene TSW. All in all, the studies carried out on the effects of Avene TSW on leucocytes indicate that this water is endowed with a tolerogenic potential.

Samples were collected during the period between January 2014 and February 2016. Geochemical processes responsible for the chemical composition of thermal and mineralized water were evaluated. The hydrochemical analysis shows that the thermal waters are characterized by the presence of two different chemical facies, the first type SO4-Ca in the east, west and south of Guelma, the second type HCO3-Ca in the south. This analysis also attributed to sodium, chlorides, and sulfates to an evaporitic terrigenous origin by the molar ratio Sr2+/Ca2+. The thermal spring waters from Guelma geothermal system have a meteoric origin, and all samples are immature with strong mixing between hot and shallow waters with 19-38.5% rate of mixing. The silica geothermometer shows that these thermal waters have a temperature varying from 84 to 122 degrees C and that the water came from a depth of 2100-3000 m through a fault system that limits the pull-apart basin of Guelma. Potential environmental effluent from thermal spas could pollute in both the irrigation and drinking waters, and which imposes danger on the health of the inhabitants of the region.

J	Somay-Altas, M; Gemici, U				Somay-Altas, Melis; Gemici, Unsal			Hydrogeochemical pattern and environmental isotope hydrology of coastal Bademli geothermal area (BGA) in western Turkey (Dikili-?zmir): A new geothermal prospect	TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Geothermal; hydrogeochemistry; isotopes; Bademli; Dikili; Turkey	THERMAL WATERS; HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS; ANATOLIA; IZMIR; GERMANIUM; FIELD; GEOCHEMISTRY; RESOURCES; CHEMISTRY; EXAMPLES	Bademli geothermal area (BGA) is located on the coastline of Dikili-Izmir province and consists of Bademli spring and Hay iota tl iota areas with 36.8-51 degrees C discharge temperatures, respectively. The waters of Hay iota tl iota borehole have remarkable seawater mixing ratios like Bademli spring and have Na-Cl water type. Dikili group pyroclastic volcanic units constitute the reservoir rock in the entire geothermal area. The heat source is relatively elevated geothermal gradient caused by extensional tectonics forming E-W trending grabens. Bademli thermal water is plotted in the "immature waters" area in the Na-K-Mg triangular diagram with a calculated seawater contribution of 18%. Therefore, some cation geothermometers are considered unreliable. On the other hand, the silica-enthalpy diagram showed an anticipated reservoir temperature of approximately 240 degrees C. Hay iota tl iota borehole water sample is plotted on the "partially equilibrated waters" area in the same triangular diagram and shows a reservoir temperature of 208 degrees C. The seawater contribution in the Hay iota tl iota area (16%) is less than the Bademli spring. On the other hand, based on the K/Mg geothermometry, the reservoir temperatures for Bademli spring and Hay iota tl iota borehole waters are 129 degrees C and 138 degrees C, respectively. B, Fe, Mn, and Sb concentrations exceed the tolerance limits of the EPA and Turkish drinking water standards in the area. In addition, due to silica-rich volcanic rocks, Ge solubility increased with temperature in thermal waters and reached 34-45 mu g/L. Enrichment of delta 18O and delta 2D values can be observed in Bademli spring and Hay iota tl iota with -3.70%o and -4.63%o, and -34.5%o and -37.9%o, respectively. From the chemical and isotopic results, it can be clearly said that this coastal geothermal area is high enthalpy, as evident from the equilibrium temperatures. However, when the thermal water rises to the surface, it mixes with both cold groundwater and modern seawater resulting in a decrease of the discharge temperatures of the springs. Moreover, according to the isotopic and hydrogeochemical data, the area has a high potential for thermal heating of the settlements in the area.

Therefore, it is constantly exposed to the xenobiotics, including inorganic ions that are ubiquitous in the environment. Some of them play important roles in homeostasis and regulatory functions of the body, also in the skin, while others can be considered dangerous. Many authors have shown that inorganic ions could penetrate inside the skin and possibly induce local effects. In this review, we give an account of the current knowledge on the effects of skin exposure to inorganic ions. Beneficial effects on skin conditions related to the use of thermal spring waters are discussed together with the application of aluminium in underarm hygiene products and silver salts in treatment of difficult wounds. Finally, the potential consequences of dermal exposure to topical sensitizers and harmful heavy ions including radionuclides are discussed.

J	MALM, J; JONSSON, L				MALM, J; JONSSON, L			A STUDY OF THE THERMAL BAR IN LAKE LADOGA USING WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA FROM SATELLITE IMAGES	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article								During spring and autumn a special thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called a thermal bar, can be observed in dimictic lakes. [A dimictic lake is a lake where a complete turnover of the water occurs twice a year (in spring and autumn).] The thermal bar is a zone of mixing that separates waters with temperatures above and below 4-degrees-C. Its practical importance is due to the possibility that it might isolate the nearshore region from the offshore region (as seen from the thermal bar), which may cause a serious pollution problem along the beach. This article presents a study of the thermal bar and its temporal behavior in Lake Ladoga, Russia, using NOAA-AVHRR CH4/CH5 data. As the thermal bar is associated with a rather characteristic temperature pattern, that is, relatively large temperature changes from the shore to the bar and weak gradients beyond implying almost isothermal conditions, satellite data can provide a good means of detecting the existence of a thermal bar. The satellite-derived water surface temperature distributions, calibrated with some in situ temperature data, show that the thermal bar progresses from the shallow southern region to the deep northern part of the lake. The thermal bar progression during spring, obtained from sequences of satellite images, is also compared with predictions from a simple theoretical model. The model assumes that the heat entering through the surface of a water column remains within the column (i.e., horizontal heat fluxes are neglected) and that complete vertical mixing takes place by convective water movements. The comparison shows a good agreement between satellite-derived an model-predicted thermal bar locations (although there are uncertainties as to certain inputs to the model). This indicates that advective and diffusive horizontal heat fluxes are not of primary importance for the thermal bar displacement and that the model is a good first approximation for predictions of the thermal bar location.

We discuss the cause of temporal variations in geochemical data in terms of temperature change in the hydrothermal system and clarify the relationship between hot-spring waters and fumarolic gases. The volcanic gas supplied from deep-seated magma was separated into liquid and vapor phases when it reached a shallow depth. Each phase formed the following three types of hot-spring water: (1) high anion concentrations and isotopic compositions similar to magmatic water, (2) lower isotopic compositions compared to type-1 waters and large variations in Cl-/SO42-, and (3) low Cl- and total anion concentrations. The formation of type-1 and type-2 hot springs was influenced by magmatic components such as HCl and SO2. We consider that type-1 hot springs are derived from the liquid phase while type-2 hot springs are derived from the vapor phase of the two-phase zone. The temporal variations in Cl-/SO42- are considered to result from temperature changes in the reservoir where liquid and vapor separated, as the HCl partitioning coefficient between the vapor and liquid phases is strongly dependent on temperature. Type-3 hot springs are derived from the vapor phase, which is depleted in HCl and SO2. We propose that the Cl- concentration of type-2 hot springs could be a measure of volcanic activity because it reflects the thermal state of the shallow two-phase zone where phreatic eruptions occur.

During the same period, mean monthly samples of meteoric water were also collected and measured for their isotopic composition. The main purpose of this study was the characterization of the acquifers and, if possible, of their recharge areas. According to the results obtained, the acquifers were divided into three main groups: (a) selenitic waters, (b) cold carbonatic waters, and (c) deep thermal waters resulting from the mixing of the other two types. Besides a mixing process between carbonatic and selenitic waters, contamination processes of thermal waters by seawater take place during their ascent. The water temperature of the acquifer feeding the thermal springs was estimated by means of various geothermometers to range between 60 degrees C and 97 degrees C, Isotope data on rainwater samples show a wide seasonal variation of both delta(18)O and delta D values. The fairly constant values of thermal waters through time and the lack of an apparent correlation with the isotopic values of rainwater suggest the existence of a deep circuit determining an almost complete homogenisation of the seasonal variations of the isotopic values.

Study focus: The effects of that drainage on river and coastal area ecosystems remain unclear. We evaluated the impact of the hot spring drainage on fish communities near the estuary. New hydrological insights: Factor analysis results obtained using water quality data show that the scale of the hot spring drainage influence on rivers differs among rivers. The inflow of hot spring drainage into the rivers affects phytoplankton more than the inflow of domestic drainage, which increases the amount of phytoplankton. Furthermore, hot spring drainage creates a better habitat for Nile tilapia, a foreign species, by increasing food availability and water temperature. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The composition of all water samples collected from the sea bottom is close to that of sea water. Nevertheless, it was possible to estimate the thermal endmember composition by extrapolating the sulfate concentration to zero. This endmember is similar in chemical composition both to waters of the Rio Purificacion and La Tuna thermal springs, located to the South along the Pacific coast of the Jalisco Block, and to pore waters from the deep-sea drilling cores from some accretionary complexes. Gas composition as well as isotopic composition of He and carbon from CO2, CH4 and C2B6 suggests an essentially thermo-biogenic origin for the gas and the presence of a high proportion of radiogenic, crustal helium. Isotopic composition of He in the Punta de Mita gas (0.4 R-a) is the lowest ever measured in Mexican hydrothermal gases. These findings do not support the idea that there exists a direct connection between the Punta de Mita springs and the last volcanic events which occurred in this area at similar to 3 Ma. Rather, this hydrothermal activity is related to deep active faulting and the existence of a deep regional aquifer or local aquifers of connate waters underlying the granites of the Jalisco Block.

Chemical and isotopic study of thermal springs and gas discharges from Sierra de Chiapas, Mexico	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL			English	Article						Isotopes; chemistry; thermal springs; water; Chiapas; Mexico	EL-CHICHON-VOLCANO; 1982 ERUPTIONS; WATER	Thermal water and gas discharges south-east of El Chichon volcano, Mexico are associated mainly with NW-SE oriented fault systems. Spring discharges include i) waters with Na-Cl composition and TDS>3000 mg/L; ii) waters with Ca-SO4 composition and TDS values between 1400 and 2300 mg/L; iii) waters with Na-Cl composition and TDS of 800 to 2400 mg/L and sulphate content up to 650 mg/L and iv) waters with Ca-HCO3 composition and low salinity (TDS <250mg/L). Most of these waters are associated with free-gas discharges of N-2 (up to 93 % by vol.), CO2 (2.4 to 31.2 % by vol.) and Ar (up to 1.25 % by vol.) with a predominant meteoric origin. H2S is present only in gas samples collected at El Azufre (up to 1.1 % by vol.). The delta C-13 CO2 values are always below -9.7% (PDB) and suggest a partially biogenic origin for CO2. Chemical and isotopic features of spring discharges indicate that fluid circulation in the Sierra de Chiapas is mainly regulated by meteoric waters that tend to infiltrate the upper and middle-Cretaceous carbonate units up to the lower Cretaceous-upper Jurassic evaporitic formations (by Lopez-Ramos, 1982). The latter provide the main source of the species in solution. No evidence for high-to-medium enthalpy systems at depth beneath the Sierra de Chiapas has been found.

Major karst springs occur where groundwater now is intercepted by hydraulic barriers, which also results in the movement of water from deeper levels. At Moneasa. thermal groundwater rises along faults and fractures associated with a thrust, and at Vascau Town, water rises along faults marginal to the Beius Basin. Geochemistry suggests that the thermal component of the Moneasa groundwaters is derived from dolomites and that at least a proportion of the Vascau thermal waters originates from deeply buried Permian sandstones.

NOV.; COMMUNITIES; SYSTEM; CAVE; DIVERSITY; WATER; POPULATIONS; BUDAPEST; INSIGHTS	The Buda Thermal Karst System (BTKS) is an extensive active hypogenic cave system located beneath the residential area of the Hungarian capital. At the river Danube, several thermal springs discharge forming spring caves. To reveal and compare the morphological structure and prokaryotic diversity of reddish-brown biofilms developed on the carbonate rock surfaces of the springs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and molecular cloning were applied. Microbial networks formed by filamentous bacteria and other cells with mineral crystals embedded in extracellular polymeric substances were observed in the SEM images. Biofilms were dominated by prokaryotes belonging to phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Nitrospirae (Bacteria) and Thaumarchaeota (Archaea) but their abundance showed differences according to the type of the host rock, geographic distance, and different water exchange. In addition, representatives of phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Caldithrix, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes Gemmatimonadetes, and several candidate divisions of Bacteria as well as Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were detected in sample-dependent higher abundance. The results indicate that thermophilic, anaerobic sulfur-, sulfate-, nitrate-, and iron(III)-reducing chemoorganotrophic as well as sulfur-, ammonia-, and nitrite-oxidizing chemolithotrophic prokaryotes can interact in the studied biofilms adapted to the unique and extreme circumstances (e.g., aphotic and nearly anoxic conditions, oligotrophy, and radionuclide accumulation) in the thermal karst springs.

A survey was carried out to study the naturally occurring alpha emitter radionuclides in popular and regularly consumed spring waters in the Balaton Upland region of Hungary and significant levels of radioactivity were found. Thirty samples were analyzed for gross alpha and beta activity concentrations by the low background gas flow proportional counter. The activity concentrations ranging from 26 to 1749 mBq dm(-3) and from 33 to 2015 mBq dm(-3) for gross alpha and beta, respectively, were observed in the spring waters. In general, the gross beta activity was higher than the alpha activity concentration. According to the results obtained, elevated level of Total Indicative Dose (TID) might be expected due to spring water consumption. In some cases, total dose might exceed the 100 mu Sv y(-1) reference level recommended by WHO. The data obtained can provide an important information for the consumers and the authorities regarding the preliminary dose exposure risk due to spring water intake. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The stable isotope values for rainfall and river waters in the Kerguelen archipelago allow a calculation of the Local Meteoric Water Line (delta D (rainfall) = 8.43 x delta O-18 (rainfall) + 11) and a summer runoff line (delta D (river) (drainage) = 7.45 X delta O-18 (river drainage) + 6). Surface waters with low- ion concentrations, chlorine facies and stable isotope values infiltrate through fractures and lava flows recharging deeper groundwaters. Thermal groundwater with low- (7 to 50 degrees C) and high- (50 to 100 degrees C) temperatures emerges in different localities in the volcanic archipelago. The low-temperature thermal waters might represent a mixture of high-temperature water with rainfall, thermal gradient changes or shallower infiltration compared to that for high-temperature thermal waters. The Rallier du Baty and Val Travers areas contain geothermal fluids with high-temperature springs, fumaroles and a large water flow. In the Rallier du Baty, the major ion chemistry and 0, H, C and S stable isotope ratio of low (7 to 50 degrees C) temperature spring waters in Rallier du Baty area demonstrate a geothermal-system recharged by meteoric water (delta D (H2O liquid) = 7.0 x delta O-18 (H2O liquid) + 0.5) rather than sea water. The chemical and isotopic compositions of elevated temperature spring waters (50 to 100 degrees C) have a long and complex history of meteoric water interacting with cooling magmas (delta D (H2O liquid) = 1.78 x delta O-18 (H2O liquid) - 23). Surficial precipitation of aragonite, kaolinite, pyrite, native sulfur attest to a long livied geothermal system. A temperature of the geothermal reservoir has been estimated between 193 and 259 degrees C by cation geothermometry. The combination of minerals observed, major ion composition of water with thermodynamic modeling and stable isotope data suggest a geothermal system with a series of water/rock interactions from 50 to 250 degrees C. The conductive cooling of rising of H2O - CO2-rich fluids have produced a H2O - CO2 phase separation with the precipitation of secondary minerals.

J	Li, N; Zhou, H; Wen, Z; Jakada, H				Li, Na; Zhou, Hong; Wen, Zhang; Jakada, Hamza			Formation mechanism and mixing behavior of Nanyang thermal spring, Xingshan County of Hubei Province, central China	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Isotopic analysis; Hydrochemistry; Silica geothermometers; Conceptual models; China	DEEP GROUNDWATER CIRCULATION; GEOTHERMAL FLUIDS; HYDROCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIA; NATIONAL-PARK; WATER; ISOTOPE; BASIN; AREA; GEOCHEMISTRY	This study elucidates the hydrochemical characteristics and formation mechanisms of the Nanyang thermal spring, situated in a typical low-medium temperature geothermal field in central China. Based on isotopic and hydrochemistry analyses, the thermal groundwater was found to originate from precipitation via the Shennongjia group of mountains. In addition, hydrochemical features of the thermal groundwater derived from the regional flow system show it is generally of Na-Cl type, with high values of total dissolved solids and minor elements (Sr, F). This is different from the shallow cold water of the local flow system which is characterized by Ca-HCO3 or Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 type. The Na-K-Mg geothermometer indicates that none of the thermal groundwater reached water-rock equilibrium during pumping, while the mixing model shows that Nanyang thermal spring comprises approximately 84.9% shallow cold groundwater and 15.1% deep thermal groundwater. Furthermore, the reservoir temperature was evaluated by chemical geothermometry and validated by fluid-mineral equilibria calculations. The results show that quartz geothermometers, along with a silica-enthalpy mixing model, can provide a consistent reservoir temperature of 136.4-145.0 degrees C (average 141.8 degrees C) considering mixing behavior. Finally, a conceptual model of the formation housing the thermal spring was developed to highlight the origin-source pathway. The conceptual model shows that the thermal groundwater originates from long-distance flow of precipitation recharged via a deep-seated fault and fracture zone (mainly the Jiuchong Fault) from the Shennongjia Mountains, and then flows upwards to the surface, mixing with the local shallow cold groundwater as it encounters an impermeable shale layer.

To assess the natural water system in Kangding County, the integrated methods of hydrochemical analysis, multivariate statistics and geochemical modelling were conducted on surface water, groundwater, and thermal water samples. Surface water and groundwater were dominated by Ca-HCO3 type, while thermal water belonged to Ca-HCO3 and Na-Cl-SO4 types. The analyzing results concluded the driving factors that affect hydrochemical components. Following the results of the combined assessments, hydrochemical process was controlled by the dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals with slight influence from anthropogenic activity. The mixing model of groundwater and thermal water was calculated using silica-enthalpy method, yielding cold-water fraction of 0.56-0.79 and an estimated reservoir temperature of 130-199 degrees C, respectively. delta D and delta O-18 isotopes suggested that surface water, groundwater and thermal springs were of meteoric origin. Thermal water should have deep circulation through the Xianshuihe fault zone, while groundwater flows through secondary fractures where it recharges with thermal water. Those analytical results were used to construct a hydrological conceptual model, providing a better understanding of the natural water system in Kangding County.

Influence of a rock glacier spring on the stream energy budget and cold-water refuge in an alpine stream	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						energy balance; fish habitat; groundwater; mountain stream; stream temperature; thermal regime	TEMPERATURE DYNAMICS; THERMAL REGIME; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIERRA-NEVADA; GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; HEAT EXCHANGES; RIVER-BASIN; TROUT; HYDROLOGY	The thermal regimes of alpine streams remain understudied and have important implications for cold-water fish habitat, which is expected to decline due to climatic warming. Previous research has focused on the effects of distributed energy fluxes and meltwater from snowpacks and glaciers on the temperature of mountain streams. This study presents the effects of the groundwater spring discharge from an inactive rock glacier containing little ground ice on the temperature of an alpine stream. Rock glaciers are coarse blocky landforms that are ubiquitous in alpine environments and typically exhibit low groundwater discharge temperatures and resilience to climatic warming. Water temperature data indicate that the rock glacier spring cools the stream by an average of 3 degrees C during July and August and reduces maximum daily temperatures by an average of 5 degrees C during the peak temperature period of the first twoweeks in August, producing a cold-water refuge downstream of the spring. The distributed stream surface and streambed energy fluxes are calculated for the reach along the toe of the rock glacier, and solar radiation dominates the distributed stream energy budget. The lateral advective heat flux generated by the rock glacier spring is compared to the distributed energy fluxes over the study reach, and the spring advective heat flux is the dominant control on stream temperature at the reach scale. This study highlights the potential for coarse blocky landforms to generate climatically resilient cold-water refuges in alpine streams.

This volcano is an interesting target for geothermal exploration, because it is a young caldera-type volcano, with thermal activity (e.g. hot springs and fumaroles). Using hydro-geochemical analyses of hot springs, we determine the type of water, origin and relation with the geothermal system, reservoir temperature, mixing process and finally the potential areas for future exploration. The analyzed water-types are bicarbonate, dilutechloride, sulphate-chloride, acid-sulphate and heated steam-acid sulfated. The conservative elements, allow to identify the correlation between different springs and to infer commune sources. Moreover, the applied solutes geothermometers for each suitable thermal-water group were used to estimate the reservoir temperature. The Silica geothermometers resulted within a range of 120 degrees C -170 degrees C while those the Cation geothermometers are above these temperatures reflecting values from 160 degrees C to 220 degrees C. However, the Cation geothermometer of low temperature clearly identify another zone of lower temperature. Mixing and recharge processes, were identified through of stable isotopes. Finally, the preliminary geothermal model shows two zones of high enthalpy system (> 150 degrees C).

Water samples from 36 geothermal wells have been collected in the main urban area of Chongqing. Chemical types of the thermal water samples are Ca.Mg-SO4 and Ca-SO4. High contents of Ca2+ and SO42- in the thermal water samples are derived from the dissolution of evaporates. Furthermore, the HCO3- concentration is constrained by the common ion effect. Drilling depth has no effect on the physical and chemical characteristics according to the results of a t-test. The geothermal reservoir's temperature can be estimated to be 64.8-93.4 degrees C (average 82 degrees C) using quartz and improved SiO2 geothermometers. Values of delta D and delta O-18 for the thermal water samples indicate that the thermal water resources originate from local precipitation with a recharge elevation between 838 and 1130 m and an annual air temperature between 10.4 and 13.9 degrees C. A conceptual model of regional scale ground-water flow for the thermal water is proposed. The thermal water mainly originates from the meteoric water recharged in the elevated areas of northeastern Tongluoshan and Huayingshan by means of percolation through exposed carbonate before becoming groundwater. The groundwater is heated at depth and moves southwest along the fault and the anticlinal core in a gravity-driven regime. The thermal water is exposed in the form of artesian hot springs in river cutting and low-elevation areas or in wells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We examined species-environment relationships and community concordance between aquatic bryophytes and insects in boreal springs. We sampled bryophytes (Marchantiophyta and Bryophyta), benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables in 138 springs in Finland, spanning a latitudinal gradient of 1000 km. Macroinvertebrates were subdivided into two groups: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera (EPTC taxa) and chironomid midges (Diptera; Chironomidae). Our aim was to test whether EPTC taxa could be used as surrogates in biodiversity surveys and bioassessment for the two less-well known organism groups, chironomids and bryophytes. 2. Bryophyte assemblages were clearly differentiated along gradients in thermal conditions and water chemistry (pH, conductivity). Chironomids and EPTC were also differentiated in relation to thermal conditions and, to a lesser extent, physical habitat variables, but were only weakly associated to spring water chemistry. Chironomids and EPTC assemblages were more concordant with each other than with bryophytes, but all concordances were relatively weak. 3. Our results suggest that even if the overall compositional patterns of the three taxonomic groups were significantly concordant, the relative importance of environmental drivers underlying their community compositions differed strongly. The results thus imply that spring bryophytes and insects are relatively poor surrogates for each other. The proportion of spring specialists was highest in bryophytes, promoting their primacy for spring bioassessment and biodiversity conservation. We suggest that adequate variation in water chemistry be assured to protect spring bryophyte biodiversity, whereas preserving the physical variation of springs is more important for macroinvertebrates.

The temperature of the geothermal springs ranges from 41 degrees C to 49 degrees C (thermal/hot waters) and 53 degrees C to 69 degrees C (scalding/hyperthermal waters). The major water types are Na-Cl and Na-HCO3, which are typical of marine and deep groundwaters influenced by ion-exchange processes. The hydrochemical parameters suggest that thermal gradient, carbonate weathering, mineral dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation are the main geochemical processes controlling the geothermal springs. The O-18 and H-2 values vary from -5.82 parts per thousand to -4.82 parts per thousand for O-18 and -33.5 parts per thousand to -24.6 parts per thousand for H-2 for all the geothermal spring water. The isotopic ranges of the groundwater are relatively smaller and more depleted than those of rainwater (H-2 = -9.8 parts per thousand and O-18 = -2.7 parts per thousand). The H-2 and O-18 signatures reveal a significant infiltration before evaporation. The H-2 and O-18 values further confirm that the waters are of meteoric origin, which implies that modern rainfall is the fundamental component of recharge derived from the infiltration of local precipitation with significant contribution of another type of water in the deeper part of the aquifer. These results provide further insight into this basement aquifer, which is a vital resource for the region.

Thermal gas-bearing artesian water exerts an uplift pressure on the impervious subsoil of the coal seam and threatens the stability of the mine bottom. The breakthrough of the mine bottom would seriously affect the groundwater regime and may endanger mining activities.

The predominance of bacteria participating in sulfur and nitrogen cycles and significant changes in the composition of microbial communities were noted at changing physicochemical conditions. Thiovirga sp. (sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, up to 37%) and Azonexus sp.

In addition, a significant contribution of the Rhodocyclaceae family (up to 51%) which is involved in the denitrification processes, and Acetoanaerobium sp. (up to 20%) fixing carbon oxide were found in the spring water. In the stream, mainly oxygenic cyanobacteria (up to 56%) developed at a temperature of 33 degrees C, in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen. In addition, sulfur bacteria of the genus Thiothrix (up to 48%) found in epibiotic communities of benthic animals of Lake Baikal were present here. Thiothrix sp. formed massive fouling in the zone of mixing lake and thermal waters with a significant contribution of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Hydrogenophaga (up to 22.5%). As well as chemolitho- and phototrophic bacteria, chemoorganotrophs (phyla Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Desulfobacterota, Nitrospirota, Fibrobacterota, etc.) have been identified in all communities. The chemical parameters of water in spring and coastal zones indicate a significant change in the composition of thermal waters occurring with the participation of diverse microbial communities that contribute to the assimilation of inorganic components of mineral thermal waters.

Diatoms from Hot Springs of the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia)	DIATOMS: FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter						Kamchatka Peninsula; thermal water; hot springs; diatom flora; algobacterial mat; bacterial flora; the chemical type of water	SPINE-BEARING	The diatom flora of 14 hot springs belonging to four geothermal fields (Malkinsky, Nachikinsky, Paratunsky, and Mutnovsky) in the south-eastern Kamchatka, were surveyed in summer-autumn period of 2012, 2013, and 2015. The diatom flora is represented by 170 species (177 intraspecies taxa) from the Classes Coscinodiscophyceae, Fragilariophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae. Most common were 25 species found in periphyton communities and in floating algobacterial mats. The main dominants in the thermas were diatoms Pinnularia acidojaponica, Achnanthidium exiguum, Caloneis bacillum, Nitzschia amphibia, Rhopalodia acuminata, and Gomphonema parvulum. The algal communities of thermal springs are mainly composed of algae of cold waters that have adapted to high temperatures. As a rule, in acidic water with the chemical type: SO4-HCO3-Na-Ca and at temperature higher than 55 degrees C, species composition of diatom communities is significantly reduced. In the diatom flora, those that are benthic, indifferent to salinity, alkaliphilic, oligo- and beta-mesosaprobic, and widely distributed species are dominant.

S	Mahala, SC	Mahala, SC			Mahala, Subash Chandra	Mahala, SC		Geological Setting	GEOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND GENESIS OF THERMAL SPRINGS OF ODISHA, INDIA	SpringerBriefs in Earth Sciences		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter deals with the geological and tectonic framework around the thermal springs. The springs are traced to occur along tectonic zones and in the absence of any active volcano, Odishan springs can only claim to be controlled by tectonic factor. These springs are either located in Gondwana graben or intersection of lineaments of Precambrian terrain. The rock assemblages around the thermal springs belong to the Iron Ore Supergroup, Easternghat Supergroup or Vindhyan Supergroup depending on their location as superimposed on the geology of the state. While the quartzites of Iron Ore Supegroup are traced around Magarmuhan and Bankhol region, khondalite, charnockite, augen-gneiss (granitic) are the litho-types encountered near the thermal springs at Attri, Tarabalo, Taptapani and Deuljhori. The rocks have suffered highest grade of regional metamorphism and are intricately folded and belong to Precambrian age. These Precambrian rocks are repository of radioactive minerals and possibly have led to increase radioactivity. Mineralogy of these rocks is discussed. The special features of the rocks of Gondwana Supegroup in so far as they control the different parameters of thermal springs are described and discussed. The rock types and their mineralogical composition are important as they play their roles during the percolation of meteoric water through them.											12	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-5369		978-3-319-90002-5; 978-3-319-90001-8	SPRINGERBR EARTH SCI			2019							23	40		10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5_3	10.1007/978-3-319-90002-5		18	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geology	BL0PZ					2023-07-04	WOS:000446323400004

Thermal springs discharge along NW-SE oriented fracture zones in two separate areas: in the main Songwe graben (Iyola, Main springs, Rambo and Kaguri) and eastern Songwe graben (Ikumbi). Lithologies forming and filling the Songwe graben are metamorphic gneiss and shist as basement rocks, overlain by the Karoo sandstones, and Red sandstones, both silt- and sandstones with a carbonatic matrix. In some areas of the graben, volcanic rocks intruded these formations forming basalt outflows. The discharge temperatures of springs are between 37 and 85 degrees C with Na-HCO3 type fluids. Carbonate deposits surround most of the springs. Using previous geophysical, geological studies and historical fluid geochemical data and mineral data, the Songwe geothermal system interpretation was updated, including new reservoir fluid temperature, fluid flow pathway and water-rock interaction models. The classical geothermometers of K-Mg and Na-K-Ca ((Mg correction)) were used to predict the reservoir fluid temperature and show that fluid emerging in the Songwe area reaches temperatures between 125 and 148 degrees C. Reservoir fluid characteristics are reconstructed based on the geothermometer calculation and a PHREEQC model in which the deep fluid reacts with certain lithologies. Minerals precipitating at the surface and reservoir depth were used to calibrate the models. The models run at surface temperature were calibrated with minerals precipitating around the springs and suggest that Songwe thermal fluids interact with Red sandstone only, while Ikumbi spring water is the only spring that interacts with all lithologies (simplified referred to as: metamorphic rocks, Karoo and Red sandstone). The model run at reservoir temperature indicates that rising water is also in contact with Karoo sandstones and Ikumbi spring water composition is again influenced by the contact with all lithologies in the graben. Our conceptual model summarizes all data showing the meteoric origin of the fluids, the travel through the basement, rising along the Mbeya fault and the main reaction with sandstones through a lateral travel towards the hot springs. The proposed models reinforce the idea that carbonate dissolution from the sandstone layers is the most common water-rock interaction. Our model is supported by carbonate deposition observed in all springs, dominated by HCO3 and Na.

Hydrothermal Activity in the Southwest Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article							HOT-SPRING BASIN; 350 DEGREES-C; NATIONAL-PARK; GEOCHEMISTRY; WATER; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEM; SEISMICITY; INTRUSION; CHEMISTRY	In the past two decades, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service have studied hydrothermal activity across the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (YPVF) to improve the understanding of the magmatic-hydrothermal system and to provide a baseline for detecting future anomalous activity. In 2017 and 2018 we sampled water and gas over a large area in the southwest YPVF and used Landsat 8 thermal infrared data to estimate radiative heat flow. Most of the thermal activity in this region is in close proximity to the Yellowstone Caldera boundary. Springs and fumaroles discharge from a variety of lithologies, including some of the youngest rhyolites in the YPVF. Gas compositions and helium isotope ratios of most samples resemble those in other parts of the YPVF. The waters have meteoric origins, and tritium was detected in several samples. Thermal waters from some areas have compositions that plot along a line connecting thermal and nonthermal water endmember compositions. The thermal water endmember equilibrated at 160 degrees C-170 degrees C, lower than waters in Yellowstone's geyser basins. Heat discharged by springs and fumaroles originates from within the Yellowstone Caldera and is transported laterally by advection, mainly along the base of rhyolite flows that cover the inferred caldera boundaries. Plain Language Summary The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field has had three cataclysmic volcanic eruptions over the past similar to 2.1 million years. The youngest of these eruptions at 0.631 Ma resulted in the formation of the Yellowstone Caldera and was followed by several smaller eruptive episodes of large volume rhyolite flows up to similar to 70,000 years ago. The diversity of Yellowstone's hydrothermal system is unparalleled with more than 10,000 thermal features that have diverse chemical compositions. To improve the understanding of Yellowstone's magmatic-hydrothermal system and to provide a baseline for detecting future anomalous activity, we sampled water and gas in southwest Yellowstone and analyzed satellite-derived thermal infrared images. Most of the hot springs and fumaroles in the study area are near the Yellowstone Caldera boundary. The area is characterized by different rock types including some of the youngest rhyolites in Yellowstone. Whereas gas compositions mostly resemble those in other parts of Yellowstone, the chemical compositions of waters differ from those within the Yellowstone Caldera. The heat and gas discharged by springs and fumaroles originate from within the Yellowstone Caldera and are transported laterally, mainly along the base of rhyolite flows that cover the inferred Yellowstone Caldera boundary.

Chemical and isotopic compositions of two warm springs and several cold springs in Burchau as well as water from the Badenweiler Spa were sampled three times during June and October 2013. Methods: A number of 70 water samples were taken at natural outlet conditions and analysed for major and trace elements, water H/O-isotope ratios and sulphur isotope ratios of dissolved sulfate. A chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) analysis was conducted to determine the underground residence time of the thermal water. To assess water-rock interactions seven rock samples representing the occurring lithological units of the study area were prepared to thin sections for polarization microscopic analysis. Results: The main spring in Burchau discharging water with a temperature up to T = 18.1 degrees C at flow rates of approximately 0.2 L s(-1) is Na-Ca-HCO3-dominated and generally low mineralised (total dissolved solids (TDS) of about 150 mg L-1). Even lower mineralisation and temperature of a nearby spring indicates further dilution with shallow groundwater. With respect to cold springs in the vicinity, the thermal water in Burchau is slightly enriched in Cl, B, Li, Rb and Cs. In nearby granites, sericitisation of plagioclase and oxidation of pyrite to goethite have been identified. The stable isotope composition of H and O suggests meteoric origin of the water. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) analyses indicate that 30% to 40% of the thermal water in Burchau is younger than 60 to 70 years. Reservoir temperatures have been estimated to 40 degrees C to 80 degrees C using sulphate and quartz geothermometers. Conclusions: Thus, the circulation time of the other 60% to 70% of the thermal water is longer than 70 years. Estimated reservoir temperatures in a range of 40 degrees C to 80 degrees C correspond to an infiltration depth of about 1,600 to 1,800 m.

Sulphuric acid geofluid contribution on thermal carbonate coastal springs (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Sulphuric acid speleogenesis; Carbonate aquifer; Thermal springs; Coastal aquifer; Italy	CAVE SYSTEM; AQUIFER; SPELEOGENESIS	Hypogenic caves, developed by sulphuric acid speleogenesis, are known all over the world among which the Santa Cesarea Terme caves have been included. They are four submerged caves, located along a coastal carbonate sector in Southern Italy and hosting the outflow of coastal springs of thermal mixed waters (from 21 to 33 A degrees C). These waters derive from the mixing of three water end members: the fresh pure groundwater of a wide karstic aquifer, the deep sulphur thermal water and the seawater. This cave system represents an almost unique case of hypogenic sea caves in carbonate environment. The thermal mixed waters have a different effect on the surrounding rocks of the caves, influencing the sulphuric acid speleogenetic process within the whole cave system. To understand the complex and overlapping natural processes acting on the development of these coastal caves, a multidisciplinary study has been carried out. This study has integrated all the data resulting from different methods and technologies, merging morphology, structural geology, hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry and mineralogy. This multidisciplinary study has allowed to define the main geochemical processes acting within these caves, including the cave development and the formation of the mineral concretions. After the introduction of H2S in the thermal waters, formed by the reduction of sulphates in the sedimentary deposits crossed at depth in the offshore, the oxidation occurs within the caves, producing sulphuric acid. Favoured by upwelling deep-seated thermal flows, this acid dissolves the limestone, with condensation corrosion process that involve replacement of limestone rock with gypsum. This process has resulted to be more active and remarkable within the Gattulla Cave, one of the Santa Cesarea Terme sea caves.	[Zuffiano, L. E.; Polemio, M.; De Giorgio, G.; Limoni, P.

The influence of ice cover on a reservoir on the development of a spring thermal bar	MOSCOW UNIVERSITY PHYSICS BULLETIN			English	Article						thermal bar; convection; mathematical modeling; fresh-water reservoir; ice cover		The features of thermal bar development and currents associated with it in a fresh-water reservoir during ice breakup in the spring are discussed. A mathematical model is defined in order to study the thermohydrodynamic process in a reservoir in both ice-free and partially covered conditions with ice of different thicknesses and lengths. Three specific phases of thermal-bar development were revealed for a reservoir covered with ice in the central part. It is shown that the features of reservoir currents in this case are connected with the formation of a deep convective vortex near the ice cover edge, which is a barrier to thermal-bar propagation. Estimation of the propagation velocity of a thermal bar during different phases of its development showed that it is independent of the presence of ice cover on the reservoir surface until the instant of its approach to the deep vortex. It was found that the lifetime of a thermal bar can differ by several times in the spring in a reservoir that is free of ice or partially covered with ice, depending on the thickness and length of the ice cover.

For this reason, the aim of this paper is to analyze the geologic and geochemical processes that determine the presence and concentration of As in wet-meadows associated to a geothermal field in Patagonia (Argentina) which is used as water supply. To achieve this, during field surveys temperature, pH and electrical conductivity were measured and water and rock samples were taken. Major ions and stable isotopes were determined in water samples while As content was analyzed in both water and rock samples. Due to geological control and chemical analyses, three areas were recognized with respect to major streams in the geothermal field: wet-meadows at headwaters, thermal springs at mid basin and wet-meadows at down basin. Even though, water in wet-meadows have the same origin the obtained results evidence how thermal springs at mid-basin influence the chemistry of these wetlands, particularly those at down basin. In the latter, As raises over two orders of magnitude than the ones at headwaters which surpasses the reference limit, proving that thermal springs are also responsible for the increase of the As content in water changing its quality as a source of potable water. The concentration of this metalloid could be higher but it is retained in travertine and sinter deposits formed near the geothermal discharge area. Understanding processes controlling water quality and the chemistry of As in this type of wetlands is of vital importance, mainly in an arid region where water supply sources are scarce.

Thermal Spring Waters as an Active Ingredient in Cosmetic Formulations	COSMETICS			English	Review						thermal water; active ingredient; cosmetic formulations	HUMAN PSORIATIC KERATINOCYTES; VITREOSCILLA-FILIFORMIS EXTRACT; VOLCANIC MINERALIZING WATER; BLUE-LAGOON; CYANOBACTERIUM-APONINUM; DENDRITIC CELLS; IN-VITRO; T-CELLS; EXPRESSION; SECRETION	Background: Thermal waters have been showing different beneficial effects on the skin due to their physicochemical composition. The beneficial effect of thermal water in the treatment of some skin diseases may thus justify its use as an active ingredient in cosmetic formulations. The main objective of this work was to demonstrate the potential of incorporating thermal water as an active ingredient in cosmetic formulations. (2) Methods: A descriptive literature review was carried out by the analysis of scientific articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Twelve thermal spring waters were found (Avene, Blue Lagoon, Comano, Cro, Dead Sea, La Roche-Posay, Monfortinho, Saint-Gervais, Salies-de-Bearn, Sao Pedro do Sul, Uriage and Vichy) with potential as an active in cosmetic products, demonstrated through in vitro studies evaluating the different activities/properties and clinical trials in healthy volunteers or with skin pathologies. (3) Results: For these studies, in natura thermal water as well as incorporated in cosmetic formulations were used. In in vitro studies, most thermal waters have been shown to have activities on membrane fluidity, skin barrier repair, antiradical, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, proliferative activity, regulation of processes involved in ageing and moisturizing properties. In clinical trials, cosmetic thermal waters reduced skin discomfort through their soothing and exhibited moisturizing and anti-irritant properties. (4) Conclusions: The effect of thermal waters on the skin and the absence of side effects reported in different studies allows them to be used as an adjuvant or in the treatment of various skin disorders and may play an important role in the cosmetics industry. However, further clinical trials are needed to assess their effectiveness and safety.	[Figueiredo, Ana Carolina; Rodrigues, Marcio; Araujo, Andre R. T.

The occurrence of trace elements in groundwater systems is one of the most significant environmental and public health concerns. The northward subduction of the Indian continental lithosphere beneath the Asian continent has produced an ongoing continental subduction zone. The Tibetan Plateau serves as the 'Water Tower of Asia', supplying drinking water to more than one billion residents in Asia. In this study, eighteen geothermal springs in the Gulu-Yadong Rrift (GYR) were selected for investigation of the geochemical characteristics of their trace elements. The geological process-related geochemical characteristics of trace elements in geothermal springs in the GYR were quantitatively assessed. The results indicated that there were high concentrations of Cr, As, B, and F in the geothermal waters in the GYR. The concentrations of Cr, As and B greatly exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water. The water quality throughout the whole rift was spatially heterogeneous. The concentrations of trace elements in only six geothermal springs were within the guidelines of the WHO, while the concentrations of trace elements in eleven geothermal springs considerably exceeded the WHO guidelines. Continental subduction-related magmatic processes, leaching and water-rock interactions may be the main factors controlling trace elements in the geothermal water. The deep circulation of the thermal water facilitated the addition of upwelling hot materials and magmatic fluids into the shallow aquifers, as well as enhancing the water-rock interactions. The results of this study indicate that geological processes have a large influence on the geochemical characteristics of trace elements in geothermal springs in the Tibetan Plateau. It is a non-negligible environmental and health issue in the plateau.

The original goal of the measurements was to identify areas of anomalous heat flow that could be interpreted as possible sites for fluid outflow. Contrary to expectations, the upper few meters of the temperature profiles in the sediments showed decreasing temperature from the seafloor down to 3 to 6 m depth indicating consistently transient temperature regimes. The only exception ( positive heat flow) was found in the Sirte abyssal plain. Measurements collected in the same area at different times indicated that the thermal structure in the bottom water and sediments had changed significantly at weekly, monthly, and interannual timescales. One-dimensional forward modeling of the conductive heat propagation into the sediment explains the observed thermal anomalies, assuming up to 0.5 K warming of the bottom waters that propagated south westward from the Matapan Trench to the crestal area of the Mediterranean Ridge. Analysis of nonsteady state thermal profiles in the upper sediment provided time information on the onset of bottom water warming, by what is now called the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT). The sediment warming started in the Matapan Trench, between spring 1992 and spring 1993, and reached the Mediterranean Ridge crest in spring-summer 1993. The average propagation velocity of the thermal perturbation along the profile is about 0.5 - 1.6 km d(-1) (0.6 - 1.8 cm s(-1)).

Probing the lethal agent in the hot spring of the Death Valley in Tashan, south of Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Death Valley; Hydrogen sulfide; Poisonous gas; Heavy metal; Tashan	AMBIENT HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; THERMAL WATERS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; EXPOSURE; MERCURY; ORIGIN	Death Valley located in the Zagros Mountains, Khuzestan Province, Iran, along the Bangeston Fault line is a unique landscape. Water flows from a hot headstream through a colorful bed into the valley for about 2 km down-run and disappears through the alluvial deposits. This spring and its surrounding area were found to be deadly for both animals and humans. In the last decade, it has been reported that five persons and many animals have died. The reason for the toxicity of this water has not yet been specified. Attempts have been made to find out the secret behind death. The purpose of this paper is to study the Death Valley, which is located in the south of Iran (Tashan), as well as the lethal agent and other index mineral compounds in its water. Air analysis was performed near the headstream to find more about the fatal gas in the area. The results showed that the concentration of hydrogen sulfide was as high as 400 ppm near the spring during hot season, which could lead to pulmonary edema and death. Water in the area contains a high concentration of sulfide (1780 mg/L), which is a characteristic of thermal or hot spring waters. This gas is available along the stream and also far from the spring. The amount of spring water is high enough to be exploited for remedial purposes.	[Motlagh, R.

The radioactive characteristics, assumed in depth, are due, in particular, to radon gas, which when released during the therapies in the indoor thermal room, determines exposure for the workers. The preliminary results of the project, the purpose of which is to analyze the totality of thermal springs, are presented. The concentrations, obtained by gamma spectrometry, show a high variability, and are comparable to those in other thermal springs in Italy and abroad. Possible correlations with geophysical factors, such as the temperature and depth of springs, have been investigated. A gedstatistical analysis of the radon data has also been carried out, through the study of the experimental variogram, obtained by kriging one map of the radon concentration: such an approach is useful not only for mapping but also for giving one possible interpretation of the examined phenomenon through structural geologic characteristics.

The geochemical analysis results show a high mineralization of the waters (EC varies between 1.28 and 3.26 mS/cm); high-temperature variation (26 to 65 degrees C) indicates a high depth emergence. The geochemical classification of waters by the piper diagram shows typical Ca-Mg waters with a dominance of sulphates. All the water points have good bacteriological quality with the exception of source No. 6, which may indicate an infiltration of domestic discharges. The thermal reservoir of Hammam Bouhanifia may represent an important source of geothermal energy in Algeria in addition to its role in the development of thermal tourism in the western region of the country.

J	Lewicki, JL; Fischer, T; Williams, SN				Lewicki, JL; Fischer, T; Williams, SN			Chemical and isotopic compositions of fluids at Cumbal Volcano, Colombia: evidence for magmatic contribution	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY			English	Article						Cumbal Volcano; hydrothermal system; cases; fumaroles; springs; geochemistry; isotopes	CONVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARIES; DEL-RUIZ VOLCANO; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; SPRING DISCHARGES; WHITE-ISLAND; NEW-ZEALAND; HELIUM; GASES; HYDROGEN; ORIGIN	We present chemical and isotopic data for fumarolic vapor and thermal spring discharges from Cumbal Volcano, SW Colombia. In 1988 Cumbal showed signs of apparent reactivation. Gases and steam condensates were sampled from summit fumaroles (83-375 degreesC) of Cumbal in 1988-1996 and discharges from thermal springs (15-37 degreesC) on its flanks in 1995-1996. Based on relative CO2, total S (H2S+ SO2), and HCl contents, fumarolic discharges are principally magmatic in composition. Fumarolic steam condensates (1993-1996) have delta O-18 values of -11.4 to +2.5 parts per thousand and deltaD values of -91 to -43 parts per thousand. delta O-18 and deltaD compositions indicate mixing between local meteoric and magmatic waters. He-3/He-4 ratios in 1993-1996 samples (5.3-7.9 R-cor) are consistent with addition of mantle-derived helium. delta C-13(CO2) values for 1996 samples (-6.7 to -5.0 parts per thousand) likely indicate contribution of marine-carbonate, organic sediment, and mantle-derived CO2. delta S-34(total) compositions (-4.6 to +5.6 parts per thousand) of 1988-1996 fumarolic discharges have magmatic signatures and may reflect cycles of deposition and remobilization of native sulfur. Thermal waters are acid-sulfate or bicarbonate in composition. concentrations of chemical constituents Relative of thermal waters imply that the composition of waters is controlled by absorption of magmatic volatiles into shallow ground- and surface waters, dilution with meteoric waters along flow paths, and dissolution of host rocks. delta O-18 and deltaD compositions are consistent with a meteoric origin of waters. delta S-34(Stotal) values for thermal spring gas discharges (9.6-10.5 parts per thousand) suggest deposition of delta S-34-depleted sulfur minerals along flow paths. Chemical and isotopic compositions of 1988-1995 fumarolic discharges provide evidence for input of magmatic volatiles into the Cumbal hydrothermal system. From 1995 to 1996, geochemical data show increasing hydrothermal signatures, suggesting a decline in magmatic volatile input.

MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES OF THE KULDUR THERMAL SPRINGS AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACCUMULATION OF MICROELEMENTS AND MINERAL FORMATION	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Thermal springs; Kuldur; microbial mat; physiological groups; bacterial abundance; microelement accumulation; mineral precipitation	RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; BACTERIA; WATER	Relevance. Despite long-term regime observations of the temperature and chemical composition of thermal waters, there is practicaly no information about the microorganisms inhabiting thermal waters and bacterial mats and their biogeochemical role. Purpose: to study the composition, the number of functional groups of bacteria in water and in microbial mats formed in different temper a-ture zones and to investigate their role in the accumulation of trace elements and the formation of minerals in the Kuldur thermal springs.The objects of study were the thermal underground waters of the Kuldur deposit of the following wels no. 1-87, 2-87, 3-87, 3-51, 5-51, as welas microbial mats formed in lakes and streams along the outflow of the Kuldur thermal springs.Methods: chemical and microbiological methods. To analyze the contents of microelements in water, the samples were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Determination of the content of chlorophyla in microbial mats was carried out spectropho-tometricaly in ethanol extracts. The number of different physiological groups of bacteria was determined on various selective media by the Koch method and limiting dilutions. Cultures were cleaned by the exhaustive stroke method. Elemental analysis of microbial mats was per-formed by the ISP-MS method on a spectrometer. The phase composition of minerals was determined using X-ray phase analysis on a dif-fractometer.Results. It is shown that the thermal waters of the studied wells are alkaline, low mineralized, sodium predominates in the composition of cations, chlorine, fluorine and sulfate ions prevail among anions. Lithium, arsenic, and strontium dominate among microelements. In the studied wells of thermal waters, a low number of bacteria of various physiological groups was noted, while their number was higher in low-er temperature waters. In microbial mats of different thermal zones, a different composition of physiological groups of bacteria was noted. Microorganisms of the geochemical cycle of sulfur, iron and manganese prevailed. The presence of cyanobacteria, which are character-ized by the presence of chlorophyla, was shown in the composition of alselected mats. A significant accumulation of many rare earth elements (especialy light) - vanadium, as well as uranium and thorium by microbial communities - was revealed. In microbial mats, silicon was predominantly deposited in the form of quartz and plagioclase.

This review underlines the cultural and social spa context focusing on hygiene issues, public health guidelines and emerging concerns regarding water management in wellness or recreational settings. The question of the "untouchability" of therapeutic natural waters and their incompatibility with traditional disinfection processes is addressed considering the demand for effective treatments that would respect the natural properties. Available strategies and innovative treatments are reviewed, highlighting potentials and limits for a sustainable management. Alternative approaches comprise nanotechnologies, photocatalysis systems, advanced filtration. State of the art and promising perspectives are reported considering the chemical-physical component and the biological natural complexity of the spa water microbiota.

J	Barquin, J; Death, RG				Barquin, Jose; Death, Russell G.			Downstream changes in spring-fed stream invertebrate communities: the effect of increased temperature range?	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Diversity; longitudinal patterns; freshwater springs; thermal constancy	LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; AQUATIC INSECTS; MACROINVERTEBRATES; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; HABITAT	Reduced thermal amplitude has been highlighted as a limiting factor for aquatic invertebrate diversity in springs. Moving downstream water temperature range increases and invertebrate richness is expected to change accordingly. In the present study temperature patterns were investigated in seven spring-fed streams, between April 2001 and November 2002, and compared to five run-off-fed streams to assess the degree of crenic temperature constancy. Temperature and physico-chemical characteristics of the water, and food resource levels were measured, and the invertebrate fauna collected at 4 distances (0, 100, 500 m and I km) from seven springs in the North and South Islands of New Zealand. Temperature variability was greater for run-off-fed streams than for springs, and increased in the spring-fed streams with distance from the source. Periphyton and physico-chemical characteristics of the water did not change markedly over the I km studied, with the exception of water velocity and organic matter biomass, which increased and decreased, respectively. The rate of increase in temperature amplitude differed greatly for the studied springs, probably being affected by flow, altitude, and the number and type of tributaries (i.e., spring- or run-off-fed) joining the spring-fed stream channel. Longitudinal changes in the number and evenness of invertebrate taxa were positively correlated to thermal amplitude (r(s) = 0.8). Moving downstream, invertebrate communities progressively incorporated taxa with higher mobility and taxa more common in nearby run-off-fed streams. Chironomids and non-insect taxa were denser at the sources. Chironomid larvae also numerically dominated communities 100 and 500 m downstream from the sources, together with Pycnocentria spp. and Zelolessica spp., while taxa such as Hydora sp. and Hydraenidae beetles, the mayflies Deleatidium spp. and Coloburiscus humeralis, and the Trichoptera Pycnocentrodes spp., all had greater abundances I km from the sources. In conclusion, water temperature range was highly correlated with number of taxa, although other factors, such as substratum composition, stability and invertebrate drift may also play an important role in the determination of longitudinal changes in invertebrate community composition and structure along spring-fed streams.

J	Oue, K; Ohsawa, S; Yusa, Y				Oue, K; Ohsawa, S; Yusa, Y			Change in color of the hot spring deposits at the Chinoike-Jigoku hot pool, Beppu geothermal field	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						hot spring deposits; thermal waters; colorimetry; geochemistry; Chinoike-Jigoku hot pool; Beppu geothermal field; Japan		The Chinoike-Jigoku hot pool in Beppu geothermal field, Central Kyushu, Japan, displays a blood-red color due to the hematite (Fe,03) deposited at the bottom of the pool. The colors of the deposits collected on I October 1990, oil 27 March 1995, and on 6 March 1996 were measured with a colorimeter. The results show that the red deposits became yellower in 1995 and 1996 than they were in 1990. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and chemical compositions of the deposits indicate that the discoloration of the Chinoike-Jigoku pool water is caused by an increase in the content of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)]. The temperature of the subsurface thermal water beneath the Chinoike-Jigoku hot pool, as estimated by the anhydrite chemical geothermometer, has declined from 200 to 150 degreesC over the past 25 years. The Na and Cl concentrations of the hot spring water discharging from Chinoike-Jigoku have decreased, while the SO4 concentration has increased. The temporal variations in subsurface temperature and dissolved ion concentrations suggest that the mixing ratio between the high-temperature, neutral Na-Cl type water and the relatively low-temperature, acid H-SO4 type water that form the thermal water of Chinoike-Jigoku has changed over the last 25 years. Hydrothermal studies of jarosite stability have confirmed that the increase in jarosite content in the deposits was caused by a temperature drop of the mixed thermal water beneath Chinoike-Jigoku pool, due to an increase in the contribution of the cooler H-SO4 water type to the thermal mixture.

Hot springs are dependable water sources, even in arid environments. They deliver reduced chemical species and other solutes to more oxidized surface environments, thereby providing redox energy and nutrients. Spring waters have diverse chemical compositions, and their outflows create thermal gradients and chemical precipitates that sustain diverse microbial communities and entomb their remnants. These environments probably were important habitats for ancient benthic microbial ecosystems, and it has even been postulated that life arose in hydrothermal systems. Thermal spring communities are fossilized in deposits of travertine, siliceous sinter, and iron minerals (among others) that are found throughout the geological record back to the oldest known well-preserved rocks at 3.48 Ga. Very few are known before the Cenozoic, but it is likely that there are many more to be found. They preserve fossils ranging from microbes to trees and macroscopic animals. Features on Mars whose morphological and spectroscopic attributes resemble spring deposits on Earth have been detected in regions where geologic context is consistent with the presence of thermal springs. Such features represent targets in the search for evidence of past life on that planet.

Hot springs outcrop in the semi-drought red layers (TDS, 0.644-8.17 g/L). Mixing with shallow cold water in the flow system is the dominant hydrogeological process leading to the decrease in thermal water temperature and complex hydrochemical compositions with water types ranging from HCO3-Ca center dot Mg to Cl-Na type. According to the silicon concentration and enthalpy evaluation, the geothermal reservoir temperatures are estimated between 118 and 204 degrees C, and the mixing ratio between cold and thermal groundwater is 0.76 on the average. The high concentrations of Na and Cl indicate that there is some well-mineralized cold water in the flow system circulating to the upward migration path accompanied with intense water-rock reactions in the fault developed basin. Ca and SO4 originate from progressively longer flow path owing to the poor solubility of gypsum, anhydrite and Ca-montmorillonite. Hierarchical clustering and multivariate statistical methods recognized three hot springs groups and four parameters groups which classified the reservoir environment into two situations, one is in the high-pressure environment with intense degassing, and the other is in the lower pressure with weak minerals migration.

J	Luo, LC; Wen, HG; Capezzuoli, E				Luo, Lianchao; Wen, Huaguo; Capezzuoli, Enrico			Travertine deposition and diagenesis in Ca-deficiency perched hot spring systems: A case from Shihuadong, Tengchong, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY			English	Article						Platform-like travertine build-up; Diagenesis; Water chemistry; Topography; Perched spring	YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; NEEDLE-FIBER CALCITE; GRAN-CANARIA ISLAND; YUNNAN PROVINCE; RAPOLANO-TERME; FIELD-MEASUREMENTS; LATE PLEISTOCENE; GEOTHERMAL AREA; TUFA DEPOSITION	Travertines are generally considered as carbonate deposits related to Ca-rich hot springs. Ca-deficiency hot springs, however, can also produce travertines under suitable conditions and little is known about the travertine deposition and diagenesis in these systems. Therefore, we studied a fossil perched Ca-deficiency spring system at Shihuadong, China to discuss its genesis and diagenesis. This systemis a platform-like build-up with travertines developing mainly in the steep frontal area. The travertines were deposited from high-temperature fluids (dominantly 45 degrees C to 55 degrees C) with strong interaction mostly with underground Gaoligong Group metamorphic rocks. Their parent CO2 was originated from magmatic CO2 and a little soil CO2. The travertine-depositing paleofluid was predominantly Ca-deficiency hot spring water, but stream water possibly from cold springs on surrounding hills might make a small contribution. The low calcium levels and flat substrate on the top area of the studied system handicapped the travertine deposition, only developing a small perched travertine channel entirely composed of crystalline crust. On the contrary, progressive CO2 degassing in the top area and increasing CO2 degassing and water flow rates in the frontal area induced the formation of abundant travertines. However, water scattering/dispersion in the frontal area might not heavily increase the water flow rate and only induced boundstone deposition. After the travertine deposition, underground thermal water, meteoric water, and microbial activity progressively altered the primary fabrics, forming mosaic and need fiber calcite cements, dissolution pores, microborings, and dissolution-induced and microbe-induced micritization. The studied perched spring system shows limited scales, notable progradation but slight aggradation, and the dearth of distal autochthonous travertines, unlike those formed by Ca-rich hot springs, which might extend widely and produce striking distal travertine deposits away from the frontal slope/waterfall. These findings suggest the significant roles of water chemistry and local topography in travertine deposition and the influence of slowly underground thermal water seeping on the diagenesis of travertines in hilly areas and might be used to recognize fossil Ca-deficiency and Ca-rich hot spring systems.

The high-discharge spring (similar to 520 L/s) has also anomalously high temperatures (9.0 degrees C), despite occurring in a region of low geothermal gradient and thick (>400 m) permafrost. Active erosion at the spring outlet forms gullies with alcove-channel-apron morphology, remarkably similar to archetypal gullies observed on mid-latitude regions of Mars. Geochemical and isotopic data show a meteoric origin for the waters, demonstrating that deep circulating groundwater systems can form active connections through the cryosphere to the subsurface, even in the absence of thermal anomalies. This discovery challenges current understanding of high-latitude permafrost hydrology.

Three springs were monitored at the convergence of rising saline water diluted with shallow groundwater in karst conduits and unmixed shallow groundwater that behaves as confined groundwater. In such a method, impulse responses of flow and fluxes are combined in order to separate hydrographs. The model explains the salinity and hydraulic head variations of the submarine and inland springs. It confirms and improves the conceptual model of this groundwater system in which mixing of saline and subsurface waters occurs. The different forces driving the upward flowing mixed water into the drainage axis and faults were studied in order to elucidate the springs' functioning. A comparative study of spring functioning is proposed, which clearly shows the very high sensitivity of the groundwater system to changes in recharge and discharge conditions.

The water samples were taken from watershed, water treatment plant, and three thermal spring recreation areas. The overall detection rate was 14.2 % (25/176) for Acanthamoeba spp. The percentages of samples containing Acanthamoeba spp. from river water, raw drinking water, and thermal spring water were 13 % (13/100), 25 % (7/28), and 10.4 % (5/48), respectively. Acanthamoeba spp. concentrations were determined according to SYBR Green quantitative real-time PCR. A plasmid-based standard curve was constructed to determine the Acanthamoeba concentration using dilution factors for achieving 1.36 x 10(9) gene copies per PCR for 18S rRNA gene in Acanthamoeba spp. The resulting concentrations varied by the type of water, in the range of 46-2.6 x 10(2) cells/l in positive raw drinking water, 2.7 x 10(2)-1.5 x 10(4) cells/l in river water, and 54-1.7 x 10(3) cells/l in thermal spring water. The presence of Acanthamoeba spp. in the raw drinking water samples was also found to have a significant difference with heterotrophic plate count. The presence of Acanthamoeba spp. in various aquatic environments may be a potential health hazard and must be further evaluated.

The highest concentration of Ra-226 were 13,000 Bq.kg(-1) in the soil and 130 Bq.kg(-1) in water respectively. The morphological and molecular analyses revealed, that the strains are not classifiable to any existing taxon. Therefore, they arc described as new taxa for science.

However, spring waters in many settings are a mixture of groundwater sources that range in physical properties and water chemistry. The objective of this work was to determine water sources of springs emerging from the North American midcontinent Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system at a fish hatchery near Lanesboro, Minnesota (USA), and compare and contrast the sources to shallower and deeper sources. The hydrology of the Lanesboro State Fish Hatchery has been studied for decades using a combination of dye tracing, thermal monitoring, geochemical sampling, and nearby borehole and outcrop observations. Previous studies are integrated with recently collected dye tracing results and geochemical data to develop a comprehensive conceptual model of groundwater flow. Dye trace findings and geochemistry indicate well-developed karst and bedrock fractures in shallowly buried unconfined carbonate formations are important transport pathways to convey anthropogenically influenced waters from the land surface to the hatchery springs. However, borehole dye traces, thermal monitoring, continuous nitrate monitoring, and mixing calculations show that a deeper confined siliciclastic aquifer is responsible for delivering relatively pristine water that accounts for about half of hatchery spring flux. Characterization of the hatchery's groundwater systems provides fishery managers with information to protect this vital resource and improved context to interpret water-quality-monitoring data that track agricultural contaminants. The methods and results of this study may be widely applicable across a large extent of the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system, and to multiaquifer sedimentary bedrock systems elsewhere.

The four main thermal springs that are the subject of the study emerge with temperatures between 32 and 60 degrees C from allochthonous formations. The reservoir temperature has been estimated from chemical compositions by utilizing simultaneously the silica, gas and sulfate-water oxygen isotope geothermometers, fluid-mineral equilibrium calculations, and a mixing model. According to these thermometric methods, the most probable subsurface temperature is in the range 75-106 degrees C. The mixing model suggests a temperature of 125 degrees C for the parent water.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a toxic gas with the smells of "rotten egg"; its toxic effects are due to the blocking of cellular respiratory enzymes leading to cell anoxia and cell damage. Case presentation. We report two cases with acute H(2)S intoxication caused by inhalation of H(2)S evaporated from the water of a thermal spring. Two victims were found in a hotel room were they could take a thermal bath. A 26-year-old male was found unconscious; he was resuscitated, received supportive treatment and survived. A 25-year-old female was found dead. Autopsy showed diffuse edema and pulmonary congestion. Toxicological blood analysis of the female revealed the following concentrations: 0.68 mg/L sulfide and 0.21 mmol/L thiosulfate. The urine thiosulfate concentration was normal. Forensic investigation established that the thermal water was coming from the hotel's own illegal well. The hotel was closed. Conclusion. This report highlights the danger of H(2)S toxicity not only for reservoir and sewer cleaners, but also for individuals bathing in thermal springs.

In this study, we present high resolution, seasonal variations in water temperature at different depths of a large deep lake on the central Tibetan Plateau. The results show that Nam Co is a typical dimictic lake whose thermal stratification begins and ends in early June and early November, respectively. Increases in the water temperature during spring and the establishment of thermal stratification in the eastern small sub-basin occur approximately one month prior to the main basin which is likely caused by the different morphometry, different water transparency during spring, and the possible presence of a spring thermal bar. The Schmidt stability of the water column is directly controlled by surface water temperature. During the ice-covered period, the homogeneous water temperature exhibits a continuous increasing trend from approximately 0.5 degrees C to 3.5 degrees C. The daily mean surface water temperature of the main open lake area is highly correlated to the air temperature but shows a hysteresis effect of approximately 38 days, which shows the significant heat storage in such a large deep lake. Nam Co is a typical lake in this area in terms of its altitude, water depth and climatic conditions, so our results have broader significance for limnological and paleolimnological studies of similar lakes on the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Geochemical Survey of low- temperature geothermal resource of the Resadiye Spa (Tokat, Northern Turkey)	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Hydrogeochemistry; Conceptual model; Isotopes; Resadiye; Turkey	ANATOLIAN FAULT ZONE; REGION; TRAVERTINES; TECTONICS; WATERS; DEFORMATION; EQUILIBRIA; EVOLUTION; VOLCANISM; SYSTEMS	The low-temperature geothermal area of Resadiye is located within the Kelkit Valley in the middle of the Black Sea region of Turkey. The area is covered with widespread travertine deposits which are acquired immediately on deposition from hot spring waters. Thermal waters have temperatures between 42 degrees C and 49 degrees C and the discharge rate is 3 L/sec. Total dissolved solids range from 3686 to 4204 mg/L. These thermal waters are of Na-HCO3-Cl type. A geothermal reservoir having probable temperature of about 100 degrees is the source of thermal water for the springs. Before emerging along the margins of exposed carbonate formations through the faults and fractures, the waters interacts sometimes with Na-rich Neogene sediments and/or with B-rich rising geothermal fluids as confirmed by high concentrations of Cl, and, to a greater degree, by the presence of B. The conductive process along with the mixing of thermal waters with shallow groundwaters is the main cooling mechanism. Deuterium and oxygen-18 signatures of thermal groundwater indicate its meteoric origin. Equilibrium states of the Resadiye thermal waters studied by means of the Na-K-Mg triangular diagram, K-Mg-Ca geoindicator diagram, and finally the activity diagrams in the systems composed of Na2O-CaO-MgO-K2O-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2-H2O phases indicate that the springs and low-temperature geothermal well waters in the area can be classified as shallow or mixed waters which are likely to be equilibrated with muscovit at temperature similar to those calculated from the chemical geothermometers. It was also observed that mineral equilibrium in Resadiye waters is largely controlled by CO2 concentration. Based on acquired data, a conceptual model of the geothermal system of Resadiye is proposed.				spasvanoglu@hotmail.com	pasvanoglu, suzan/GXF-0587-2022	pasvanoglu, Suzan/0000-0002-0026-9259					54	0	0	0	13	PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD	OXFORD	THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND	0375-6505	1879-3576		GEOTHERMICS	Geothermics	JUL	2021	94								102088	10.1016/j.geothermics.2021.102088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2021.102088		MAR 2021	13	Energy & Fuels; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Energy & Fuels; Geology	TE7UU					2023-07-04	WOS:000670214000004

The origin and spatiotemporal evolutionary processes of its hot and saline springs however remain unclear. Geochemical and isotopic (O-18, H-2, H-3) studies have therefore been conducted on the water from the geothermal and saline springs in the NQ-QD Basin. All saline springs in the study area are of the Na-Cl geochemical type while geothermal waters show different geochemical types. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the springs in the NQ-QD Basin are primarily controlled by meteoric water or ice-snow melt water and are influenced by rock-water interactions. It is found that the saline springs in the study area are derived from the dissolution of halite and sulfate that occur in the tertiary Gongjue red bed, while the hot springs in the QD Basin are greatly influenced by the dissolution of carbonatites and sulfates from the Bolila (T(3)b) and Huakaizuo (J(2)h) formations. Results from silica geothermometry and a silicon-enthalpy hybrid model indicate that the apparent reservoir temperatures and reservoir temperatures for the hot springs in the QD Basin range from 57-130 degrees C to75-214 degrees C, respectively. Deuterium analysis indicates that most of the hot springs are recently recharged rain water. Furthermore, the saline springs have a weaker groundwater regeneration capacity than the hot springs. Tritium data shows that the ranges of calculated residence times for springs in this study are 25 to 55 years, and that there is a likelihood that hot springs in the QD Basin originated from two different hydrothermal systems. The geochemical characteristics of the NQ-QD springs are similar to those of the Lanping-Simao Basin, indicating similar solute sources. Thus, the use of water isotope analyses coupled with hydrogeochemistry proves to be an effective tool to determine the origin and spatiotemporal evolution of the NQ-QD spring waters.

Two groundwater types were identified: HCO3-Ca and SO4-Ca, whose existence is determined by, respectively, interactions with the Jurassic limestone leading to the dissolution of carbonates, and the presence of evaporite deposits (Triassic) along the circuit of upwelling. The waters emerge through a system of deep and recent faults. The water temperatures vary from 26 to 68 degrees C, characterizing a geothermal energy of low enthalpy. The application of various chemical geothermometers gives temperatures of the thermal reservoir ranging from 70 to 110 degrees C, similar to those calculated by the equilibrium curves of saturation indices. The combined analysis of these results, compared to the geothermal gradient in the region, enabled us to identify the Jurassic limestone as the thermal reservoir where the waters have circulated at depths of more than 1800 m.

A joint transit of these gases through the fault structures was established. Distribution pattern of hydrogen and helium concentrations in the Red River Rift area (northern Vietnam) was obtained from the extensive gas and water sample data. Intense linear anomalies are associated with the Red River Rift and the Dien Bien regional rift. Seismic events are associated with the fault, and earthquake epicenters are located in the Dien Bien Province.	[Syrbu, N. S.; Shakirov, R. B.; Kholmogorov, A. O.; Iakimov, T. S.; Kalgin, V.

To identify the primary factor controlling spring blooms, in the spring of 2010 and 2011, a field monitoring plan was carried out in the area (XX) where serious blooms outbroke in XXB The environmental factors which includes Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), nutrients, water temperature, secchi depth, etc. were involved. According the comparative analysis on the environmental factors of spring 2010 and 2011 in XXB, We study the relationship between water temperature and Chl-a. The results show that the spring blooms in 2010 is earlier than that in 2011. Comparative analysis on water temperature in the two years showed that surface temperature in spring 2010 continued to rise earlier than in 2011, and also the time that surface temperature continued to rise is the same to the time Chl-a concentrations increased. When the total nitrogen (TN) concentrations decreased, relative water column stability increased, and the time that mixing depth (Z(mix)) decreased were the same to the time when the surface temperature continued to rise. While the Water temperature increased, utilization of algal on nutrient, promoted development of thermal stratification, Increase of relative water column stability, and the sudden decrease of mixing depth resulted in the blooms. Rising surface temperature continued to rise was one of the primary induction factors to the spring blooms in XXB.

Mixing geochemistry of cold water around non-volcanic thermal springs in high-grade metamorphic terrain, Sri Lanka	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Thermal water; Cold water; Geochemistry; Geothermometer; Mixing	GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; HOT-SPRINGS; NA-K-CA-CL-SO4-H2O SYSTEM; MINERAL SOLUBILITIES; TURKEY; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; AREA; GROUNDWATER; ANATOLIA; BALCOVA	A geochemical survey was conducted on thermal water and cold water around non-volcanic geothermal fields at Mahaoya and Marangala in Sri Lanka. One hundred forty-two samples were analyzed for fifteen selected irons to investigate geochemical relationships resulting from water-rock interactions and mixing. Based on measurements using a Na-K-Mg geothermometer, the maximum temperatures of thermal reservoirs were estimated to be 148 degrees C in Mahaoya and 191 degrees C in Marangala, which were higher values than those obtained using Na-Li and Li-Mg geothermometers. This suggests that the reservoirs extend from intermediate to deep levels. Hydrogeochemistry of thermal waters is distinct from that of cold water; higher contents of Na, K, Cl, F, SO4, and TDS in thermal water are most likely due to the dissolution of feldspar, mica, and sulfide minerals in the granitic rocks. Conversely, lower values of Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, and Pb imply less ferromagnesian minerals in the basement. Classification based on major ions reveals a Na-K-SO4 type of thermal water for Mahaoya and Marangala. Cold water is dominated by the Na-K-HCO3 type, which indicates,deep groundwater influence by iron exchange. Non-mixing cold water indicates a Ca-HCO3 type. In general, chemistry of cold water wells (<400 m) close to the thermal water changes significantly due to direct mixing of thermal water and cold water. In comparison, a contrasting action occurs with increasing distance from the geothermal field. Gradual decline of SO4 with increasing distance from thermal water may indicate a trend of clear oxidation. However, the chemistry of more distant wells demarcates deep circulations through fractures and faults in the basement. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Jayawardana, D.

Nazemalhosseini			Occurrence of Thermotolerant Hartmannella vermiformis and Naegleria Spp. in Hot Springs of Ardebil Province, Northwest Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY			English	Article						Hot springs; Hartmannella; Naegleria; Iran	FREE-LIVING AMEBAS; CONTACT-LENS WEARER; MIXED INFECTION; ACANTHAMOEBA; MENINGOENCEPHALITIS; LEGIONELLA; FOWLERI; PCR	Background: Geothermal waters could be suitable niches for thermophilic free living amoebae including Naegleria and Harlmannella. Ardebil Province, northwest Iran is popular for having many hot springs for recreational and health purposes activity. The present research is the first molecular based investigation regarding the presence of Naegleria and Hartmannella in the hot springs of Ardebil Province in Iran. Methods: Overall, 30 water samples were taken from waters of thermal hot springs in Ardebil Province, Iran during 2010-2011. All collected samples were transferred to Dept. of Parasitology and Mycology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Cultivation of concentrated water samples was performed using culture-enrichment method. Cloning of the target amoebae was obtained and morphological and molecular analysis was done using page key combined with two sets of primers, respectively. Sequence analysis and homology search was used for strains identification. Results: Of 30 water samples, 8 (26.7%) were positive for thermotolerant Vahlkampfiids and Hartmannella based on morphological characteristics of vegetative form and double walled cysts. Cloning of the target amoebae were done successfully. Sequencing of the positive isolates revealed that the strains belonged to Naegleria (N. carteri and N. spp) and H. vermiformis. Conclusion: The result highlights a need for improved filtration and disinfection and periodic monitoring of recreational thermal waters in order to prevent disease related to free- living amoebae. This is the first comprehensive molecular study of thermophilic Naegleria and Hartmannella in hot springs of Iran.

The origin and transport Of CO2 and its effects on water-rock interactions during transfer through the shallow crust and discharge to the atmosphere are described. Diagrams and cross-comparison of isodistribution maps of: (1) heat-flow; (2) delta(18)O of thermal springs; (3) elevation of thermal springs; (4) calculated pCO(2) in thermal springs; (5) He-3/He-4 ratio in gas vents; (6) Sr concentration in thermal springs; (7) Sr concentration in travertines; (8) delta(13)C in CO2 gas emissions; and (9) delta(13)C of fossil and active travertines, show systematic geographic zonation in values of delta(13)C in CO2 gas and travertines, Sr concentration in thermal springs and travertines, pCO(2) in thermal springs and the He-3/He-4 ratio in gas phases sampled at surface in central-southern Italy from the western back-arc volcanic Tyrrhenian sector towards the eastern foredeep Adriatic sector. In their lateral westward flow towards the Tyrrhenian coast, meteoric waters precipitating in the high eastern Apennine range mix with ascending magmatic, metamorphic and geothermal fluids in the highly permeable Mesozoic limestones. This fluid mixing causes transfer of poorly condensable components (among which CO2 and H2S) into the regional aquifer and enhances dissolution of limestone to occur faster than in typical, non-thermal karst systems. The carbon isotopic compositions of travertines precipitated along the peri-Tyrrhenian sector are correlated with the carbon isotopic compositions of parent CO2 (metamorphic or organic), whereas the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of travertines inherit the isotopic signature of the dissolved Mesozoic carbonate rock. Although subduction is presently inactive in the northern-central Apennines, the distribution of fluids is typical of active volcanic arcs. Because travertine precipitation is clearly related to climate conditions and all dated travertines in Italy are younger than 500 ka, the analysis of data, in particular the parallel areal distribution of Sr concentration in present thermal springs and fossil travertines, suggests that the westward regional fluid motion has been ongoing since at least 500 ka.

The marine contribution generally disturbs chemical and isotopic geothermometers.

In this study, we characterized the spring water microbiome of Comano Terme (Italy) at four sampling points of the thermal spa, including natural (spring and well) and human-built (storage tank, bathtubs) environments. We integrated large-scale culturing and metagenomic approaches, with the aim of comprehensively determining the spring water taxonomic composition and functional potential.ResultsThe groundwater feeding the spring hosted the most atypical microbiome, including many taxa known to be recalcitrant to cultivation. The core microbiome included the orders Sphingomonadales, Rhizobiales, and Caulobacterales, and the families Bradyrhizobiaceae and Moraxellaceae. A comparative genomic analysis of 72 isolates and 30 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed that most isolates and MAGs belonged to new species or higher taxonomic ranks widely distributed in the microbial tree of life. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values calculated for each isolated or assembled genome showed that 10 genomes belonged to known bacterial species (>95% ANI), 36 genomes (including 1 MAG) had ANI values ranging 85-92.5% and could be assigned as undescribed species belonging to known genera, while the remaining 55 genomes had lower ANI values (<85%). A number of functional features were significantly over- or underrepresented in genomes derived from the four sampling sites. Functional specialization was found between sites, with for example methanogenesis being unique to groundwater whereas methanotrophy was found in all samples.ConclusionsCurrent knowledge on aquatic microbiomes is essentially based on surface or human-associated environments. We started uncovering the spring water microbiome, highlighting an unexpected diversity that should be further investigated. This study confirms that groundwater environments host highly adapted, stable microbial communities composed of many unknown taxa, even among the culturable fraction.

Environmental parameters made it possible to recognise three types of water : one issuing from a "cool spring", with lowest temperature (mean : 26.7 degreesC), conductivity and chloride concentration; one issuing from the "hot spring" (mean : 31.7 degreesC) with the highest temperature and high conductivity; and the one of the oued itself with into which both springs flow This oued had the highest values of pH, conductivity, chlorides, and calcium. The interstitial fauna collected by means of artificial substrates was composed of both epigean and stygobite species. Only the "cool spring" included stygobite species, the number of which generally decreased with depth.

CO2 Outgassing from Spring Waters	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						CO2 outgassing; Springs; Carbonate	GAS TRANSFER VELOCITIES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; THERMAL SPRINGS; EXCHANGE; GEOCHEMISTRY; RIVERS; LAKES; GROUNDWATER; ATMOSPHERE; ESTUARIES	CO2 released from lakes, rivers, and estuaries has been included in estimates of the global CO2 budget; however, CO2 released from carbonate springs has not been routinely included in the estimate of the global CO2 budget. The omission of carbonate spring water as a source of CO2 might result in an underestimation of the overall flux of CO2 from surface waters to the atmosphere. In this study, the flux of CO2 from carbonate springs was calculated and compared to the rate of outgassing of CO2 reported in the literature for other surface water bodies. The calculated fluxes of CO2 from carbonate springs ranged 280-380,000 mmol m(-2) d(-1). A range that is larger than the range of CO2 fluxes reported for estuaries (100-1900 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), headwater streams and rivers (100-1600 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), freshwater lakes (-300 to 3200 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), and saline lakes (-300 to 9900 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). This work demonstrates that the outgassing of CO2 from springs should be included in the global CO2 budget.

Patients included in this open [abetted, 2 parallel groups,, multicentric study, were randomly assigned to apply five times daily for ten weeks either the Avene spring water get (n=35) or trolamine cream (n=34). The median of emergence of the first objective radiation dermatitis signs was 31 days in the ATSW get group and 21) days in the control group (p=0,924). The median incidence for pruritus in patients of the ETA get group was 46 days versus 27 days (p=0,028) and 44 days versus 24 days for pain (p=0,426). Global efficacy was "very good" in 46,7 % of patients of the ETA get group versus 17,2 % (p=0,029) and tolerance was "very good" in 65,5 % of the ETA get group versus 40,7 % (p=0, 107). No radionecrosis was observed. In conclusion, the efficacy of the Avene spring water get was similar to the control product in prophylaxis of radiation dermatitis. Tolerance was better and the pruritus was significantty more delayed in patients who applied the Avene spring water get than in controls. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Laist, DW; Taylor, C; Reynolds, JE				Laist, David W.; Taylor, Cynthia; Reynolds, John E., III			Winter Habitat Preferences for Florida Manatees and Vulnerability to Cold	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WARM-WATER REFUGES	To survive cold winter periods most, if not all, Florida manatees rely on warm-water refuges in the southern two-thirds of the Florida peninsula. Most refuges are either warm-water discharges from power plant and natural springs, or passive thermal basins that temporarily trap relatively warm water for a week or more. Strong fidelity to one or more refuges has created four relatively discrete Florida manatee subpopulations. Using statewide winter counts of manatees from 1999 to 2011, we provide the first attempt to quantify the proportion of animals using the three principal refuge types (power plants, springs, and passive thermal basins) statewide and for each subpopulation. Statewide across all years, 48.5% of all manatees were counted at power plant outfalls, 17.5% at natural springs, and 34.9% at passive thermal basins or sites with no known warm-water features. Atlantic Coast and Southwest Florida subpopulations comprised 82.2% of all manatees counted (45.6% and 36.6%, respectively) with each subpopulation relying principally on power plants (66.6% and 47.4%, respectively). The upper St. Johns River and Northwest Florida subpopulations comprised 17.8% of all manatees counted with almost all animals relying entirely on springs (99.2% and 88.6% of those subpopulations, respectively). A record high count of 5,076 manatees in January 2010 revealed minimum sizes for the four subpopulations of: 230 manatees in the upper St. Johns River; 2,548 on the Atlantic Coast; 645 in Northwest Florida; and 1,774 in Southwest Florida. Based on a comparison of carcass recovery locations for 713 manatees killed by cold stress between 1999 and 2011 and the distribution of known refuges, it appears that springs offer manatees the best protection against cold stress.

Common Spring Types in the Valley and Ridge Province: There Is More than Karst	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Session on Springs - Groundwater-Influenced Ecosystems, Gaining Streams, and Wetlands held at the Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America (GSA)	2018	Indianapolis, IN	Geol Soc Amer		Environmental Geology; Hydrogeology; Springs; Karst; Appalachians	FLOW; DISCHARGE; PATTERNS; VIRGINIA	The Valley and Ridge Province (V&R) of the central Appalachians is rich in springs that support ecosystems, provide local water resources, and export water from the region. Although there has been extensive research on springs in the province, the focus has been on chemically variable karst springs. The purpose of this work is to identify common spring types found in the V&R based on an analysis of three regions. Three types of V&R springs are included in this comparison, and their relationship to more general classification systems is included. Headwater springs, located near ridge tops and along ridge flanks, are typically small, may be ephemeral, have localized flow paths, and are associated with siliciclastic units. Karst springs, generally located in the valleys, include both the more chemically variable limestone springs and the more stable dolomite springs. Thermal warm springs, with temperatures higher than the mean annual air temperature, are less common than the other spring types; they may be large and are typically associated with major thrust faults. The temperature, chemistry, and locations of the springs are controlled by the structural geology and topography as well as the formations and lithologies through which the recharge water travels. There is overlap in the water chemistry and storm responses of the spring groups, but some general trends can be identified, such as lower pH in the headwater springs. The V&R springs are critical resources, but their sustainability, chemistry, and hydrology need to be considered within the local geologic framework.

The variation of water surface temperature with time for different areas of the lake is discussed using temperature measurements obtained by means of an aircraft-mounted IR-radiometer. Maximum values of water surface temperature in these areas, as well as the time lags between the areas are determined. Mean rates of temperature variation for the periods of warming and cooling of the lake are also determined. A formula for determining the location of the spring frontal zone at different stages of water warming is suggested. The peculiarities of the interaction of stratified and isothermal waters in the frontal zone, the slope of the frontal zone and the thermal balance components are discussed on the basis of specialized field measurements by using ships and aeroplane. The scales of temperature inhomogeneities are obtained based on computation of 2D spatial correlation functions.

Eleven water points with temperatures within the range 16-40-degrees-C and salinity between 0.6 and 2.4 g/l are distributed along the superficial contact between the Mesozoic carbonate aquifer formations outcropping on the relief and the low-permeability deposits of the Pisan plain. Hydrogeological and geophysical investigations, as well as periodic geochemical and isotopic samplings and temperature measurements of the different water-points, were carried out during the period 1988-91. These observations indicate that thermal, low-tritium, calcium-sulphate waters rise toward the surface from a reservoir made up of a Triassic evaporitic sequence through a buried fault located in the vicinity of the margins of the Pisan Mountains. The presence of a low-permeable cover, represented by Quaternary and Neogenic deposits, allows only the local upflow of thermal water and a poor flow rate at the warmest springs. These springs, located in the central part of the prospect, are used in the Spa facilities. Most of the thermal water, blocked by the impervious cover, moves laterally within the system and mixes with young, cold, meteoric water. Most of the water points represent mixtures in different proportions of the Spa water and this meteoric component. The local carbonate outcrops probably represent the main recharge areas for the system. However, assuming that a regional circulation could be present, a large amount of water, at temperatures between 70 and 80-degrees-C, as suggested by geothermometric indications, could be found at depth.

The hydrochemical composition of mineral water is the decisive factor for mineral-water quality. Based on the hydrochemical data of 74 mineral water samples collected from 2018 to 2020, the characteristics and formation mechanism of the hydrochemical components of the mineral water were analyzed. The results show that the formation of single-type mineral springs (metasilicate mineral water) is controlled by rock weathering; compound mineral springs (metasilicate mineral water with high CO2 content) are the product of CO2-rich, weakly acidic, confined hot groundwater with high salinity, which are mixed with shallow groundwater as rising along the fracture. The volcanic geological process greatly influences the formation of the hydrochemical components of mineral springs on the North slope of Changbai Mountain. The mineral springs on the Longgang Mountain are greatly affected by human activities. The results of cluster analysis only consider that hydrochemical components are consistent with the classification of the areas which concentrated distributions of mineral as determined by hydrogeological and geomorphological studies. The results of this study are useful for understanding the distribution, hydrochemical characteristics, and formation mechanism of mineral springs in the Changbai Mountain area of China and provide the theoretical basis for the protection and development of mineral spring.

J	Baioumy, H; Nawawi, M; Wagner, K; Arifin, MH				Baioumy, Hassan; Nawawi, Mohd; Wagner, Karl; Arifin, Mohd Hariri			Geochemistry and geothermometry of non-volcanic hot springs in West Malaysia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hot springs; Malaysia; Geothermometer; Saturation indices; Origin; Energy	THERMAL WATERS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; FIELD; AREA; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; EQUILIBRIA; ORIGIN; SILICA	Although more than sixty hot springs have been reported in West Malaysia, their geochemistry, geothermometry and utilization as a potential energy source have not been considered yet. This study reports the geochemistry, geothermometry and mineral saturation indices of a number of hot springs in West Malaysia. The potential of these hot springs as a source of geothermal energy as well as their origin and possible mixing with surface cold waters have been discussed. Surface temperatures of the studied hot springs range from 41 to 99 degrees C and pH values vary between 5.5 and 9. Geochemical data showed that among cations, Si, Na, Ca and K occur in relatively high contents, while Mg and Fe show very low concentrations. On the other hand, HCO3 is present in relatively high concentration compared to other anions (SO4, Cl and F). Data also illustrated that most of the studied hot springs are K-Na-bicarbonate rich waters although they represent different geological provenances in West Malaysia reflecting homogeneity in the geological formations and/or hydrochemical processes governing the characteristics of these waters. This homogeneity also indicates the insignificant effect of local geology on the chemistry of the studied hot springs. Saturation indices calculations of the studied thermal waters indicate that most of the secondary mineral phases such as goethite and hematite are apparently supersaturated while quartz and chalcedony are saturated. Conversely, amorphous silica is slightly under-saturated. These results suggest similar rock-water interactions for both geothermal and non-geothermal waters. The geological settings of the studied hot springs either in or close to granitic masses or along the major fault or shear zones as well as the Na-bicarbonate nature of the waters and low sulfate concentrations suggest their non-volcanic origin. They are also similar in their geological setting and water chemistry to other non-volcanic hot springs in other parts of the world. However, the possible mixing of the original hot waters with near surface cold water is evident from the clear disagreement between the silica and cation geothermometers as well as the disequilibrium with their associated host rocks as indicated from the plot of studied hot springs in the Na-K-Mg ternary diagram and saturation indices calculations. Quartz geothermometers gave equilibrium temperatures ranging from 93 degrees C in the Ayer Hangat hot spring to 154 degrees C in the Lojing hot spring. This requires 398 to 649 kJ/kg energy to heat the water suggesting an intermediate enthalpy. These results also pointed out that some of the studied hot springs have potential to generate adequate heat, which could be harnessed for energy generation upon further work to prove their viability.

The aim was to quantify the seasonal fluxes of water and heat in the active layer from spring thaw to fall freeze-back. Liquid water content was measured in frozen and unfrozen soils using time domain reflectometry. Liquid water was present in frozen soil at temperatures down to -12 degrees C, and its volumetric fraction increased with temperature before melting occurred. The ground thermal regime during spring thaw and fall freeze-back was dominated by latent heat fluxes that stabilized soil temperatures at 0 degrees C for extended periods. The transfer of large amounts of latent heat released by freeze-back in the fall suggested convective heat transfer mechanisms. Seasonal fluxes of heat and water were well described using a simple zero-dimensional model of water and energy balance. The dominant heat sinks during the spring and summer were sensible and latent heat fluxes into the atmosphere. During fall freeze-back the dominant heat source was phase change. The soil heterogeneity strongly impacted hydrologic and thermal processes in the active layer. Two direct consequences were the development of preferential flowpaths and the preferential freezing of the profile during freeze-back.

The waters studied mostly belong to the bicarbonate type, some hot springs being rich in chlorides; their temperature varied between 29 degrees C and 57.5 degrees C. In total 92 taxa of algae belonging to the Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta have been identified from 13 samples and the diatoms comprised 80 taxa. The species recorded from the hot springs are not different from. those observed from other water bodies of Burundi; they are considered as thermo-tolerant species. A canonical correspondence analysis based on the diatom species, physical and chemical variables separated the hot springs with low mineralisation from the springs with high mineralisation and showed that the conductivity, bicarbonates and chlorides seem to be more important in their separation.

Out of the 40 hot springs covered, the study identified 9 hot springs having a high potential for development, 14 having medium potential and the remaining 17 having low or least potential for development. This conclusion was arrived at after considering the technical and economic feasibility of the various hot springs. Technical feasibility criteria includes geological factors, water quality, temperature and how rate. The economic feasibility criteria considers measures such as accessibility, current and market potentials in terms of visitors, surrounding attractions and existing inventory and facilities available. A geological input indicates that high potential hot springs are located close to or within the granite body and associated with major permeable fault zones. They normally occur at low elevation adjacent to topographic highs. High potential hot springs are also characterised by high water temperature, substantial flowrate and very good water quality which is important for water-body contact activities such as soaking. Economic criteria for high potential hot springs are associated with good accessibility, good market, good surrounding attractions like rural and village setting and well developed facilities and infrastructures.

Hydrogeochemistry of the thermal waters from the Sciacca Geothermal Field (Sicily, southern Italy)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Sciacca Geothermal Field; Fluid geochemistry; Sicily Channel; Isotope geochemistry	CHANNEL; GEOCHEMISTRY; CHEMISTRY; STRAIT; SEA	The Sciacca basin (southern Sicily, Italy), well known since the Roman times for the importance of its thermo-mineral waters, is characterized by a large occurrence of thermal fluid discharges whose main thermal aquifer is located within the Triassic carbonate rocks. This reservoir represents the deepest formation cropping out in the area. Shallower and cooler thermal aquifers are located within the Tertiary limestone and Quaternary sand and gravel deposits. In this work new geochemical and isotopic data of thermal waters and dissolved gases from springs and wells were investigated to assess the origin of thermal fluids and the structure of the hydrothermal system. The main thermal aquifer, at about 60 degrees C and located at 43 m a.s.l., is fed by an O-18-enriched (delta O-18 similar to +4 parts per thousand; delta D similar to 0 parts per thousand)thermal marine end-member, affected by cooling and dilution (1:2) caused by mixing with inland-originated meteoric waters (delta O-18 similar to -8 parts per thousand; delta D similar to -58 parts per thousand). This meteoric recharge is likely related to the area of Ficuzza and San Genuardo Mts., located 12 and 23 km N of Sciacca, respectively, at an altitude comprised between 900 and 1180 m a.s.l. After this primary dilution, the deep thermal aquifer, emerging at the "Antiche Terme Selinuntine" discharging site, is not apparently affected by further dilution processes in the Sciacca area, where the sedimentary cover does not allow infiltration of local meteoric waters down to the Triassic reservoir. Conversely, the shallower thermal aquifers hosted within the Tertiary-Quaternary sedimentary horizons are locally supplied by direct infiltration of meteoric water occurring at variable altitudes, up to about 400 m a.s.l. (San Calogero Mt.). With the only exception of the Molinelli thermal spring, direct contribution from the deep thermal end-member to thermal springs fed by the shallower aquifers can be considered negligible.

The spring is of low TDS and Na-Ca-HCO3 type, and its temperature is 38 degrees C. Chemical and isotopic analyses suggest that the hot water is meteoric in origin and undergoes a deep circulation to about 1900 m. The temperature of the geothermal reservoir is approximately 66-67 degrees C. The residence time of the hot water is estimated to be about 40 years with the Ra-Rn method. It is a hot spring that is representative of low temperature. It occurs in sedimentary rocks and is not directly controlled by faults.

Therefore, we herein examined the inhibitory effects of radon inhalation and hot spring water drinking on potassium oxonate (PO)-induced hyperuricemia in mice. Mice inhaled radon at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) for 24 h or were given hot spring water for 2 weeks. Mice were then administrated PO at a dose of 500 mg/kg. The results obtained showed that serum uric acid levels were significantly increased by the administration of PO. Radon inhalation or hot spring water drinking significantly inhibited elevations in serum uric acid levels through the suppression of xanthine oxidase activity in the liver. Radon inhalation activated anti-oxidative functions in the liver and kidney. These results suggest that radon inhalation inhibits PO-induced hyperuricemia by activating anti-oxidative functions, while hot spring water drinking may suppress PO-induced elevations in serum uric acid levels through the pharmacological effects of the chemical compositions dissolved in it.

In the study area, the estimation of tritium-tracer mean transit times (MTTs) in the mixed thermal waters is lacking despite available tritium measurements in 1977 and 2013 and carbon-14 measurements in 2008. As a direct tracer of water movement, tritium radioisotope with a half-life of 12.32 years has been applied to estimate transit times of young waters, especially in the mixture of young and old water components, and tritium sampling was conducted in 2017 to reduce the ambiguity involved with tritium interpretation. For the study area, two scaling factors of latitude effect are established for anthropogenic and ambient tritium levels in precipitation to obtain continuous time-series of tritium in monthly precipitation from the Tokyo area. Annual weighted tritium concentrations in recharge are estimated as a difference between monthly precipitation and evaporation data and are utilized as the tritium input in the convolution integral to obtain tritium-tracer MTTs. Using the exponential piston-flow model (EPM), the representative MTT of shallow groundwater is estimated to be 12.5 +/- 4.5 years at TDW-1 well and 15.5 +/- 8.5 years at RDW-1 well and uncertainties in MTT due to the EPM ratio and scaling factor are found to be low. For two thermal springs, simulated tritium concentrations of the young groundwater in mixed thermal waters produce unique MTT solutions resulting in MTT of 28.0 +/- 12.0 years for THS-1 spring and of 29.5 +/- 12.5 years for RHS-1 spring and scaling factor uncertainties are lower than EPM ratio uncertainties, which could be further reduced by an additional tritium sampling. Combining carbon-14 concentrations of 2008 samples with tritium-tracer, the old water MTTs of THS-1 and RHS-1 thermal springs equal to 13500 +/- 1500 years and 6900 +/- 900 years, respectively, and aggregate MTTs of mixed water are 9189 +/- 1023 years for THS-1 spring and 4701 +/- 616 years for RHS-1 spring. Using these MTTs with the effective porosity values of 0.01 and 0.03 result in the geothermal reservoir volume of the Tural-Rajwadi area to vary between 347.3 +/- 23.3 km(3) and 115.8 +/- 15.4 km(3), respectively, and these volumes could be used to estimate the recharge area with geothermal system depth obtained from deep drilling. In conclusions, we highlight that the environmental tritium provides important information on water circulation in the Tural-Rajwadi area and similar tritium-tracer investigations of young and mixed waters could be conducted in other geothermal areas in Asia.

J	Pasvanoglu, S; Celik, M				Pasvanoglu, Suzan; Celik, Mehmet			A conceptual model for groundwater flow and geochemical evolution of thermal fluids at the Kizilcahamam geothermal area, Galatian volcanic Province	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Kizilcahamam geothermal field; Hydrogeochemistry; Enviromental isotopes; Hydrothermal model; Central Anatolia; Turkey	HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; CRYSTALLINE BEDROCK; MINERALIZED WATERS; FIELD; PART; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; EQUILIBRIA; DISCHARGES; TECTONICS; CHEMISTRY	Ktzticahamam geothermal area is one of the most important geothermal fields in the Galatean Volcanic Province northern Central Anatolia of Turkey. Kizilcahamam geothermal field is liquid-dominated system that have been developed in the rugged terrain, and usually consists of a geothermal systems that occur commonly associated with terrestrial volcanism. This field is characterized by thermal and mineralized springs, travertine, with wide alteration zones. Thermal waters are issue through the faults and fracture zones of the volcanics. The temperatures of the wells in the Kizilcahamam town center varies between 42 and 81 degrees C, whereas the temperature of thermal and mineralized water springs in the area of Actsu Stream and Seyhamam varies between 23 and 43 degrees C. Electrical conductivity values for thermal waters are between 1029 and 3700 mu S/cm. Thermal waters in Kizticahamam area are mainly Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Ca-HCO3 type, with high salinity, while cold groundwater is mostly of Ca (Na, Mg)-HCO3 type, with lower salinity. Both waters of Kizdcahamam town center and Actsu Stream appear to be derived from a deeper reservoir fluid, whereas Seyhamam thermal waters are compatible with shallow cold waters heated by steam absorbing high temperatures. High contents of some minor elements in thermal waters, such as F, B, Li, Rb, Sr and Cs probably derive from enhanced water rock interaction. The isotopic values of thermal water (delta O-18, delta H-2, delta H-3) indicates their deep-circulating meteoric origin and allow estimation of infiltration altitude ranging between 1350 and 1750 m.a.s.l.This datum, supported by structural data, suggests the Isikdag and Alucclag Mountains as the recharge area of the system. As frequently observed in many geothermal systems positive O-18 shifts of Kizilcahamam thermal waters relative to the local meteoric line were considered to be primarily due to interaction with host rocks at elevated temperature (T > 150 degrees C) and from CO2 exsolution of thermal and mineral springs. In this system, geothermal waters are heating by an intrusive-cupola and geothermal gradient, followed by the waters rising to the surface along faults and fractures that act as hydrothermal conduits. A conceptual hydrogeochemical model was developed for a hydrogeological flow system in the Kadcahamam Region.

The large number of positive Legionella samples indicates a potential risk of infection to patients, especially those undergoing inhalation treatment with thermal water, or those using a whirlpool or taking a shower. In those inhalators actually in use, no Legionella could be detected. Thus they are no source of infection when they are maintained and serviced properly. Thermal disinfection and service checks at regular intervals are suggested for the contaminated systems.

These hot springs have water temperatures >58 degrees C and are located along the southeast coastal area of the peninsula. We used C-14, H-3, delta O-18, delta H-2, and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope data for the Dongrae and Haeundae hot spring waters collected over 2004-2014 to investigate the groundwater cycle and heat source for these hot springs. The stable isotope compositions of O and H suggested meteoric origin of the hot spring waters. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for the Dongrae and Haeundae hot spring waters have been steady for 11 years at 0.70567 +/- 0.00002 and 0.70607 +/- 0.00002, respectively, suggesting that they are in a near equilibrium state. The C-14 age of the Dongrae hot spring waters ranges from 1,401 to 2979 years BP, and that of the Haeundae hot spring waters from 1930 to 6687 years BP. We observed a strong correlation between Sr-87/Sr-86 and C-14, as well as delta O-18. Therefore, the hot springs in the Busan area were supposed to be heated by a paleo-heat source, suggesting that there may be no current heat source under the present crustal conditions. This study also demonstrates that monitoring of the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and C-14 in the groundwater and deep thermal water can be used as a proxy for tracing the heat source of geothermal waters such as hot springs and an indicator of groundwater mixings between upper and lower aquifers in granite area.

The architecture of the tectonic edifice, below the Pleistocene Cimino and Vicano volcanic districts cover, is characterized by the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Tuscan Nappe and the similar Umbria-Marche Succession; both are capped by the overthrusted Ligurian Late Cretaceous-Eocene Tolfa Flysch. A shallow unconfined volcanic aquifer is separated, by a thick aquiclude, from the deep confined carbonate aquifer consisting of the Tuscan Nappe and the Umbria-Marche Succession. The volcanic aquifer hosts cold waters, whilst the carbonate aquifer hosts hot sulphate-alkaline earth waters that emerge in the thermal area of Viterbo with a temperature of 30-60A degrees C. The recharge area of cold waters is located in the Cimini Mountains. Thermal waters of the Viterbo hot springs are derived from a circuit of waters that emerge along the River Nera near Narni (about 34 km ENE of Viterbo), with a high salinity, a temperature of 16-18A degrees C, a sulphate-alkaline earth composition, and a discharge of 13 m(3)/sec, whose recharge area is located in the central pre-Apennines reliefs.

The CTMax of all B. japonica tadpoles was over 41degreesC indicating that the tadpoles are heat-tolerant. At Rushan, we monitored the temporal and spatial distribution of tadpoles over a 24-h period in a 220cm x 70cm plot that is fed by a geothermal hot spring. The thermal profiles of the plot varied seasonally, but the highest water temperature selected by tadpoles remained similar (ca. 37degreesC). In the winter, the thermal range of the plot was lower (29.5-40.6degreesC). and tadpoles could be found in the majority of the plot. In contrast, during the spring and summer the temperature ranges of the plot were higher (33.1-49.8degreesC and 33.0-42.4degreesC, respectively), and tadpoles could be found only in the cooler sections of the plot, especially around 1000h with direct solar radiation. These results suggest that extreme heat tolerance and behavioural thermoregularity (i.e., heat avoidance behaviour) are the main means by which B. japonica tadpoles cope with high temperatures in geothermal hot springs.

The accessibility to quality drinking water has become a challenge and is receiving renewed attention. A total of 96 samples from twelve springs were collected and analyzed for major drinking water quality parameters. Piper trilinear and Durov diagram depicted dominance of Ca-Mg-HCO(3)hydrochemical facies and simple dissolution and mixing process. Water quality was falling in very good to excellent class and well within the desirable limits of WHO thereby indicating huge potential for meeting rising drinking water demand. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the generation of three components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) with higher eigenvalues of 3 or more (3-6) explaining 40, 21, and 17% of the overall variance in water quality data sets, respectively. The components obtained from PCA indicate that the parameters responsible for variations are mainly related to discharge, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (natural), nutrients (agriculture), and cation and anions (lithology). The results suggest that the hydrochemistry of springs is jointly controlled by lithology and anthropogenic inputs.

Equilibrium of Nitrogen-Rich Spring Waters of the Baikal Rift Zone with Host Rock Minerals as a Basis for Determining Mechanisms of Their Formation	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Baikal Rift Zone; nitrogen-rich spring waters; formation of secondary minerals; causes of low salinity; evolution model	NITRIC THERMAL WATERS; HIGH-FLUORIDE; HOT-SPRINGS; GEOCHEMISTRY; GROUNDWATER; ORIGIN; AREA	This paper presents calculations of equilibria between nitrogen-rich hot springs of the Baikal Rift Zone (BRZ) and a secondary mineral assemblage (carbonate, fluoride, clay, zeolite, and other minerals). The results confirm the equilibrium-nonequilibrium character of the nitrogen spring water-rock system. Unlike other water types, the system evolves under conditions of continuous incorporation of chemical elements released from the host minerals into the newly formed secondary minerals. This allows the system to remain dynamically stable with no increase in salinity, despite continued water-rock interaction. The main factor responsible for this state of the system is a deficiency of acids, i.e., high pH. As a result, the disturbance of relationships between concentrations of aqueous species compared to the starting composition of dissolved solids produces a deficiency of some elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, etc.) and an excess of other elements (Na, Si, F, etc.).

Most thermal springs in Rajasthan are tightly associated to the several regional NE-SW strike-slip faults bordering NE-SW ridges formed by Archaean rocks at the contact with Quaternary alluvial and aeolian sedimentary deposits of the Rajasthan desert. Their Ca-HCO3 immature character and isotopic composition reveals: (1) meteoric origin, (2) relatively shallow circulation inside the crystalline Archaean formations, (3) very fast rise along faults, and (4) deep storage temperatures of the same order of magnitude as discharging temperatures (50-90degreesC). Thermal spring discharges in Gujarat are spread over a larger area than in Rajasthan and are associated both with the NNW-SSE fault systems bordering the Cambay basin and the ENE-WSW strike-slip fault systems in the Saurashtra province, west of the Cambay basin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of springs in both areas suggest a meteoric origin of deep thermal waters. They mix with fresh or fossil seawater entering the thermal paths of the spring systems through both the fault systems bordering the Cambay basin, as well as faults and fractures occurring inside the permeable Deccan Basalt Trap in the Saurashtra province. The associated gas phase, at all sampled sites, shows similar features: (1) it is dominated by the presence of atmospheric components (N-2 and Ar), (2) it has high crustal He-4 enrichment, (3) it shows crustal He-3/He-4 signature, (4) it has low CO2 concentration, and (5) the only analysed sample for C-13/C-12 isotopic ratio in CO2 suggests that CO2 has a strong, isotopically light organic imprint. All these features and chemical geothermometer estimates of spring waters suggest that any active deep hydrothermal system at the base of the Cambay basin (about 2000-3000 m) has low-to-medium enthalpy characteristics, with maximum deep temperature in the storage zone of about 150degreesC. In a regional overview, both thermal emergences of Rajasthan and Gujarat could be controlled by the counter-clockwise rotation of India. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

RADON LEVELS MEASURED AT A TOURISTIC THERMAL SPA RESORT IN MONTAGU (SOUTH AFRICA) AND ASSOCIATED EFFECTIVE DOSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						alpha particles; cancer; lungs; human; radon	WATER; EXPOSURES	Radon activity concentrations (in water and in air) were measured at 13 selected locations at the Avalon Springs thermal spa resort in Montagu (Western Cape, South Africa) to estimate the associated effective dose received by employees and visitors. A RAD-7 detector (DURRIDGE), based on alpha spectrometry, and electret detectors (E-PERM (R) Radelec) were used for these radon measurements. The primary source of radon was natural thermal waters from the hot spring, which were pumped to various locations on the resort, and consequently a range of radon in-water analyses were performed. Radon in-water activity concentration as a function of time (short term and long term measurements) and spatial distributions (different bathing pools, etc.) were studied. The mean radon in-water activity concentrations were found to be 205 +/- 6 Bq L-1 (source), 112 +/- 5 Bq L-1 (outdoor pool) and 79 +/- 4 Bq L-1 (indoor pool). Radon in-air activity concentrations were found to range between 33 +/- 4 Bq m(-3) (at the outside bar) to 523 +/- 26 Bq m(-3) (building enclosing the hot spring's source). The most significant potential radiation exposure identified is that due to inhalation of air rich in radon and its progeny by the resort employees. The annual occupational effective dose due to the inhalation of radon progeny ranges from 0.16 +/- 0.01 mSv to 0.40 +/- 0.02 mSv. For the water samples collected, the Ra-226 in-water activity concentrations from samples collected were below the lower detection limit (similar to 0.7 Bq L-1) of the gamma-ray detector system used. No significant radiological health risk can be associated with radon and progeny from the hot spring at the Avalon Springs resort.	[Botha, R.; Newman, R.

A total of 30 samples were collected from the lakes, streams, groundwaters, the subaqueous hot and cold springs, and on-land hot springs, and Cr, Fe, As, Sb, and Pb concentrations were determined. Elevated concentrations of Fe, As, and Pb were detected in most of the samples; the sources of which are either the natural or anthropogenic discharge of the geothermal springs and seawater mixing. As and Pb concentrations in some locations are found to exceed both acute and chronic exposure criteria for aquatic life, posing a threat to the species hosted by these environments. To determine the magnitude of pollution, HPI calculations were carried out. The average and maximum HPI values for the cold waters are 297.1 and 1162.9, respectively, both of which are higher than the critical pollution index value. The highest HPI values are observed in samples taken from the Dalyan Channel and Alagol Lake. In general, pollution levels increase from north to south, reaching the maximum value at the outlet point, due to the increased contribution from thermal water discharge and mixing with seawater.

If groundwater flow velocities are sufficiently high, most of the subsurface heat transport can occur by advection. This is the case, for example, in the Cascades volcanic arc where much of the background geothermal heat is transported advectively and then discharged when the groundwater emerges at springs. The temperature of spring water can thus be used to infer the geothermal heat flux. If spring water temperature is many degrees warmer than the ambient temperature, as it is at hot springs, determining the heat discharged at springs is straightforward. At large-volume cold springs, however, the geothermal warming of water is small because the added heat is diluted in a large volume of water. We show that in order to interpret the temperature of cold springs we must account for three processes: ( 1) conversion of gravitational potential energy to heat through viscous dissipation, ( 2) conduction of heat to or from the Earth's surface, and ( 3) geothermal warming. Using spring temperature data from the central Oregon Cascades and Mount Shasta, California, we show that the warming due to surface heat exchange and dissipation of gravitational potential energy can be comparable to that due to geothermal heating. Unless these confounding sources of heating are taken into account, estimates of geothermal heat flux derived from temperatures of cold springs can be incorrect by large factors.

Travertines from the Troll thermal springs, Svalbard	NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY			English	Article							RAPOLANO-TERME; DEPOSITS; NORWAY; TUFA	The Troll and Jotun hot springs are located along the Bockfjorden fault zone at 79 degrees 23'N on Svalbard and represent the northernmost thermal springs documented on land. They are recharged through subpermafrost aquifers supplied mainly by glacial meltwater and derive their Ca and CO2 contents from Proterozoic marbles. Gases exsolved from the 25 degrees 28'C hot spring waters are N-2 and CO2-dominated with high contents of He (reaching 1.5% in the Jotun springs) and Ar. The temperature distribution and temporal variation in the main Troll spring have been constrained by IR-photography and by temperature loggers embedded in the springs and associated, water-filled travertine pools over a period of one year. High-resolution micro-drilling techniques have allowed detailed stable isotope profiles to be obtained from selected travertine cross-sections. The data reflect seasonal fluctuations in temperatures during travertine growth and constrain the travertine growth rate. Most of the travertine growth occurs during the summer season as most of the flooded travertine pools were probably frozen for about 6 months per year. Oxygen isotope variations among the travertine terraces partly reflect fluctuations in the spring source composition. These fluctuations have been used to constrain the temporal evolution of the terrace system.

The thermal sulfidic springs reach the surface in the core of the anticline where the river valley reaches the top of a Meso-Cenozoic limestone succession, capped by less permeable rocks. An important terraced travertine deposit was produced by the thermal water throughout the Pleistocene. The most interesting caves are in the valley of the Rio Garrafo, a tributary of the Tronto River. These caves developed mainly below the valley bottom, and a part of the stream water sinks through preexisting karst passages mixing with the thermal groundwater similar to 50 m below. Water temperature in the caves reaches 42 degrees C, and the water has high salinity (up to > 6 g L-1) with elevated levels of chloride, sulfates and carbonates. Sinking water from the caves and the travertine plate is responsible for the significant dilution of thermal water at the main spring, located 2 km downstream, in the Tronto Valley. The speleogenetic process is mainly related to H2S oxidation, which is enhanced by the recharge of oxygenated fresh water from the surface. Cave development occurred in different phases. Early passages formed mainly in the phreatic zone, due to the rising thermal water. Deepening of the main surface stream (Tronto River) caused lowering of the water table. As a result, the Rio Garrafo caves were partly dried and invaded by sinking water, while rising gases activated condensation corrosion and the growth of replacement gypsum crusts.				galdenzi.sandro@tiscali.it							17	4	4	0	1	SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG	CHAM	GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND	2364-4591		978-3-319-53348-3; 978-3-319-53347-6	CAVE KARST SYSTEMS			2017							169	182		10.1007/978-3-319-53348-3_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53348-3_10	10.1007/978-3-319-53348-3		14	Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology	BK2NT					2023-07-04	WOS:000433342000011

Previous studies indicate that a decline in aquifer pressure is an obvious indicator of thermal water overexploitation. However, many thermal water producing aquifers display a subtle temperature change rather than a pressure decline. Due to the importance of monitoring temperature change, temperature detection is an important topic in the sustainable management of geothermal fields. In this study, we used borehole temperature-depth curves, obtained from boreholes measured over half-year intervals from 2011 to 2014, as well as the Mann-Kendall method, to determine trends for subsurface temperature within the Jiashi Hot Spring in Taiwan. Our results indicate that trends for subsurface temperature are related to hydrogeology and the flow field of groundwater. Groundwater/thermal water flow directions are impacted by the exploitation of thermal water in production wells, according to their depths and distributions, but pressure declines are not a dominant feature. Repeatedly measured borehole temperature-depths and their resultant curves provide important information for understanding trends in subsurface temperature change within a geothermal field.

Chemical analyses of the spring waters (n = 33) were carried out to characterise the waters and determine their origin. A continuum of compositions was observed between relatively lower temperature (7 degrees C) HCO3-Ca-Na dominated waters with relatively low amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) and high Eh, and higher temperature (39 degrees C) HCO3-Na-Ca dominated waters with higher TDS and lower Ehthis reflects largely conservative mixing of these components between near surface low temperature, oxidising groundwaters and higher temperature, more reducing thermal waters derived from a deeper geothermal reservoir. Stable isotopic data are consistent with all the water ultimately being derived from meteoric water that has undergone varying degrees of isotopic fractionation following evaporation. The inferred O-18 and H-2 isotopic composition of the unfractionationed meteoric waters is lighter than that expected that of mean annual local precipitation, which together with a strong negative correlation between O-18 and the elevation of the sampled discharging springs, suggests recharge at higher elevations (1600 m to 3000 m; average 2600 m). Reservoir temperature, calculated using geothermometers and an analysis of saturation indices of plausible reservoir minerals, ranged from 70 degrees C to 100 degrees C at an inferred depth of 2 to 3 km. Not all chemical components were found to follow conservative mixing behaviour. In particular, (i) the CO2 contents of the waters were highly variable, suggesting either varying degrees of degassing and/or near discharge admixture with air, and (ii) SO4 concentrations in the lower temperature thermal CO2-rich waters were highly variable, suggesting a role of near surface oxidation processes, for example of pyrite, in modifying the concentration of redox sensitive components. Limited C-13 data are consistent with the CO2 predominately being derived from dissolution of metamorphic/igneous carbonate minerals in the reservoir. Based on geological conditions, isotope and chemical data, a conceptual circulation model of the Choygan hydrothermal system is proposed.

Obliteration of thermal springs by groundwater flows in sedimentary basins of Brazil	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Thermal springs; Thermal conditions; Groundwater flow; Sedimentary basins; Brazil	HEAT-FLOW; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; FLUID-FLOW; TEMPERATURE; WATER; CIRCULATION; MODELS	Analysis of geothermal and hydrogeologic characteristics of Paleozoic interior basins of Brazil has identified an association between the geographic distribution of thermal springs and areas of occurrences of groundwater flow. Specifically, thermal springs are found to be absent in regions inferred to have lateral flows of groundwater. This trend is evident in the basins of the Amazon region, in the central parts of the Parnaiba basin and in the west-central parts of the Parana basin. Model studies help to elucidate mutual exclusion of regions of thermal springs and sub-horizontal flows of groundwater. Numerical simulations indicate that groundwater flows with velocities a parts per thousand yen 1 cm/year are capable of masking the occurrence of thermal anomalies. Also, down flow through distributed recharge zones can lead to development of large zones of relatively low temperature. The observational data sets of temperature gradients and Peclet numbers have been employed outlining advection-convection domains of subsurface strata in the sedimentary basins of the Amazon region, Parnaiba and Parana. Results obtained indicate that thermal buoyancy forces are incapable of overcoming advective flows in basins of the Amazon region. Similar conditions are also found to prevail in the central parts of the Parnaiba and Parana basins.	[Vieira, F. P.; Hamza, V. M.] Natl Observ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alexandrino, C.

We investigated the seasonal variations of water temperature and discharge in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River by analyzing multi-year (2004-2018) hydrological and water temperature data. The effects of upstream dams on the thermal regime, density currents and phytoplankton blooms in TGR were examined. The results show that water temperature in TGR increased in spring (+1.1 degrees C) and winter (+0.8 degrees C) seasons after the filling of upstream reservoirs compared to the years before. Longer duration of stratification is associated with a smaller discharge and a longer water residence time. Moreover, the increase of inflow, which was at least partially due to upstream dam construction, lead to the weakening of stratification during the spring season. As a consequence of the higher water temperature in TGR in spring, the density-driven exchange flows between the main reservoir and tributary bays have changed. Over-flows became more frequent, which promoted the deepening of the surface mixing layer, and resulted in a dramatic reduction in the frequency and biomass of phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays of TGR.

J	Hoblea, F; Gallino-Josnin, S; Audra, P				Hoblea, Fabien; Gallino-Josnin, Stephanie; Audra, Philippe			Genesis and functioning of the Aix-les-Bains hydrothermal karst (Savoie, France): past research and recent advances	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE			English	Article						Thermal-sulfidic karst; Dye-tracing; Hypogenic caves; Condensation-corrosion; Aix-les-Bains; France	CAVE	Aix-les-Bains (Savoie, France) owes its name and reputation to the thermal springs that occur along the eastern shore of Lake Bourget, France largest natural lake. Although the city waters have been exploited since Antiquity, scientific investigations into the nature and characteristics of the hydrothermal karst from which they emerge did not begin until the early 19(th) century. The present article traces the history of these investigations and summarizes the results of more than two centuries of scientific research. Today, the only visible signs of karstification related to hydrothermal flows are to be found in the discharge zone in the Urgonian limestone anticline that rises above the city centre. These features are: - the Grotte des Serpents, which houses the Alun Spring, the system main natural discharge, - the Chevalley Aven, a blind chimney that was accidentally uncovered in 1996, - other hydrothermal springs that are too small to enter, including the Soufre Spring. Although scientific investigation of the thermal springs at Aix-les-Bains began in the early 19(th) century, it was not until the 1920s that scientists started examining the relationship between karstification and the state of the aquifer. E.A. Martel was the first researcher to describe the Aix-les-Bains site as an active hydrothermal karst, in a pioneering study published in 1935. Sixty years later, the discovery of the Chevalley Aven during building work on a new hydrotherapy center gave fresh impetus to research into the karstification of the Aix-les-Bains thermo-mineral aquifer. Recent studies have also investigated the deep aquifer below the karst, using data provided by boreholes. The Urgonian limestone karst at Aix-les-Bains is the site of mixing between thermal waters rising through the anticline and meteoric waters percolating from the surface. Meteoric infiltration is sufficiently high for the hydrological behavior of the thermal springs to be identical to that of exsurgences in gravity-fed, cold-water transmissive karsts. The Chevalley Aven is a shaft that descends 30 meters below the surface, thereby providing access to the ground-water at depth. Monitoring of the water quality in the aven has shown that the Legionella contamination of the springs was due to high concentrations of the bacteria in upstream passages in the karst. In 2006, dye-tracing tests confirmed the existence of a hydraulic connection between the Chevalley Aven and the Alun and Soufre Springs, the fact there is a single ascending hydrothermal conduit, which lies between the Chevalley Aven and the Alun Spring. In addition to providing a valuable source of information about the functioning of the thermo-mineral aquifer, the cavities at Aix-les-Bains are of great karstological interest, especially for the study of hypogene speleogenetic processes. The circulation of warm (40 degrees C), sulfur-rich waters and vapors through the system has led to the development of conduits with specific morphologies and the precipitation of characteristic deposits. These features include: - "beaded" chimneys and galleries formed by the linking of spheres produced by condensation-corrosion. Diffuse karstification along bedding planes around the main conduit; - deposition of non-carbonate minerals (gypsum, native sulfur); - formation of biothems and biofilms on walls subject to condensation. The Grotte des Serpents is a horizontal cavity that formed at the upper limit of the water table. The Chevalley Aven is a hypogene chimney that was sculpted under vadose conditions by the release of sulfuric acid-rich vapors above the thermal water table. As well as a surface coating of microbial mats and the presence of bacterial flakes in the thermal water, the vadose parts of the Aix-les-Bains hydrothermal karst contain a characteristic microfauna and flora. These microorganisms are thought to play an active role in hypogene karstification processes.

MHG extracts, commercial antioxidants, and three distinct types of thermal spring water were used in a sunscreen cream formulation. Their bioactive capacity, chemical and rheological properties were evaluated. MHG Cytisus scoparius flower extract provided the highest bioactive properties. Pleurotus ostreatus MHG liquor exhibited the highest total solid extraction yield. The Brassica rapa MHG sample stood out for its total protein content and its monosaccharide and oligosaccharide concentration.

Twenty-two hot springs from different regions were selected and monitored for H2S concentrations using a portable gas meter. Respective mean concentrations of H2S in hot springs indoor air were 9.11 +/- 11. Ghotour Souei hot springs had the highest concentration of H2S with a mean concentration of 29.4 +/- 7.7 and 25.2 +/- 8.16ppm at the source and general pool areas, respectively. Oxidation-reduction potential and pH of the water were the most important factor influencing H2S concentrations in the hot springs. H2S concentrations in indoor air of Ardabil hot springs were noticeably higher than OEL-TWA and OEL-STEL, and therefore may pose important risks for human health on both short-and long-term exposures.

Structural Settings and Hypogenic Flow Paths for Three Colorado Caves	HYPOGENE KARST REGIONS AND CAVES OF THE WORLD	Cave and Karst Systems of the World		English	Article; Book Chapter						Geologic structure; Thermal springs; CO2; Limonite; H2S		Colorado, a state with diverse geology and high topographic relief, contains several significant hypogene cave systems. Three are described here: the Orient Mine Cave System, Cave of the Winds, and Glenwood Caverns. All are located near present thermal springs, which help to determine the chemistry of the cave-forming water. The Orient Mine Caves were encountered during mining operations to extract limonite ore for the manufacture of steel. The ore follows the bedding, but hypogene cave galleries also cut across bedding and extend upward as domes. The galleries were formed by warm water rising along the San Luis fault and mixing with cool recharge from nearby mountains. Cave of the Winds follows the plunge of an anticline and probably formed when water with high CO2 rose along faults and mixed with shallow meteoric water. At Glenwood Caverns, carbonic acid in rising thermal water is responsible for most speleogenetic dissolution, but some dry parts of the cave have a sulfuric acid overprint.	[Maslyn, R.

Corcho			Noble gas, CFC and other geochemical evidence for the age and origin of the Bath thermal waters, UK	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							GROUNDWATER; SPRINGS; CARBON	The city of Bath is a World Heritage site and its thermal waters, the Roman Baths and new spa development rely on undisturbed flow of the springs (45 degrees C). The current investigations provide an improved understanding of the residence times and flow regime as basis for the source protection. Trace gas indicators including the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), together with a more comprehensive examination of chemical and stable isotope tracers are used to characterise the sources of the thermal water and any modern components. It is shown conclusively by the use of Ar-39 that the bulk of the thermal water has been in circulation within the Carboniferous Limestone for at least 1000 years. Other stable isotope and noble gas measurements confirm previous findings and strongly suggest recharge within the Holocene time period (i.e. the last 12 kyr). Measurements of dissolved Kr-85 and chlorofluorocarbons constrain previous indications from tritium that a small proportion (<5%) of the thermal water originates from modern leakage into the spring pipe passing through Mesozoic valley fill underlying Bath. This introduces small amounts of O-2 into the system, resulting in the Fe precipitation seen in the King's Spring. Silica geothermometry indicates that the water is likely to have reached a maximum temperature of between 69-99 degrees C, indicating a most probable maximum circulation depth of similar to 3 km, which is in line with recent geological models. The rise to the surface of the water is sufficiently indirect that a temperature loss of >20 degrees C is incurred. There is overwhelming evidence that the water has evolved within the Carboniferous Limestone formation, although the chemistry alone cannot pinpoint the geometry of the recharge area or circulation route. For a likely residence time of 1-12 kyr, volumetric calculations imply a large storage volume and circulation pathway if typical porosities of the limestone at depth are used, indicating that much of the Bath-Bristol basin must be involved in the water storage.

The major elements, trace elements, and stable isotopes of four groups of hot spring water samples and two groups of gas samples collected from the intersection of the Altyn Tagh fault zone and the East Kunlun fault belt were investigated in this study. The hot spring water temperature ranged between 6 degrees C and 14 degrees C. The water chemistry types of the hot springs were Na center dot Mg-Cl, Mg center dot Na-Cl center dot HCO3, Na-Cl center dot SO4, and Na-Cl center dot HCO3. The delta D values ranged from -50.00% to -68.60%, while the delta O-18 values ranged from -6.90% to -8.60%. The hot spring water was recharged mainly by infiltrating precipitation, with a recharge elevation of 3390 similar to 3676 m. The heat storage temperature ranged from 66.7 to 164.9 degrees C. The circulation depth was estimated to range between 1043 and 2679 m. The strontium isotopic composition of the water samples in response to the main weathering sources comprised carbonate and sulfate. CO2 was the main component in the hot spring gas in the study region, and its content was over 95%. The He-3/He-4-R/Ra relationship diagram revealed that the mantle-sourced helium from the Yitunbulake spring was 3.06%. In comparison, that from the Aiken spring was 7.38%, which indicated an intrusion of mantle-source material mixed into the hot springs in the study region. The crustal marine limestone contributed significantly to the carbon inventory of the hot spring gas samples (>75%). The dissolution of the marl aquifer resulted in the release of CO2. Carbon was primarily obtained through metamorphism and hydrothermal reactions in the basement lithologies. The Yitunbulake and Aiken hot springs are found near the intersection of the Arjin and East Kunlun fractures, where the water-rock response is relatively strong and the depth of circulation and thermal storage temperature are both high. This causes relatively high ambient pressure to be released from the deep fluid, resulting in microseismic activity in this region. The continuous observation of Aiken spring water chemistry allows for the monitoring of fracture activity in the region. The results of the study could serve as a foundation for further exploration of the relationship between geothermal water and deep faults, shallow geological formations, hydrogeological conditions, and geothermal resource development in the region.

However, the influence of seawater intrusion on hot springs are still not fully understood. Typical ten hot springs in and around the Anak-Sinchon Uplift in a coastal area of the northern Korean Peninsula were investigated. All the hot springs were near-neutral to weakly alkaline. High TDS value of 25300 mg/L was found at the hot spring closest to the coastline. TDS values, and concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl- and SO42- in the hot spring waters near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline. According to the calculation of seawater fraction, three hot springs near the coast were contaminated by seawater. Temperatures of the geothermal reservoir were estimated to range from 103 to 170 degrees C, which were interpolated by thin plate spline to predict the local trend of the reservoir temperature distribution. Mg2+ concentration was used to determine the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion. Among the three seawater-contaminated hot springs, very low Mg2+ concentrations in two hot spring waters probably indicate that they were mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards; relatively high Mg2+ concentration in the hot spring water closest to the coastline likely indicates that it was mixed with seawater again during the ascent from the geothermal reservoir. The geochemical modeling performed with PHREEQC indicates that dolomitization of calcite and precipitation of anhydrite were the dominant water-rock interactions for the seawater-contaminated hot spring waters.

Activity concentrations of Rn and Ra isotopes were measured in sixteen hydrothermal springs of northwestern Algeria. Samples displayed high activities, especially for 222Rn, 224Ra and 226Ra (up to 377 x 103 Bq/m3, 730 Bq/m3 and 4470 Bq/m3, respectively). Approximately, 50% of the investigated springs displayed activities of combined long-lived Ra (226Ra + 228Ra) in excess of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of the WHO and EPA for drinking water. Factors controlling the distribution of radionuclides in the aquifer system are investigated. The observed correlation between Ra isotope and TDS suggests that adsorption/desorption is not the dominant process controlling the distribution of Ra in waters. Our results indicate that the excess SO42- limits the concentration of dissolved Ba2+ and thereby, the elevated Ra activities in these hydrothermal systems are not simply limited by co-precipitation with BaSO4 (barite). The data shows that Ra activities are likely dominated by the recoil process of parent isotopes in the aquifer solids. The minimal abundance of clay minerals and oxides in the aquifer, in addition to thermal activities in northwestern Algeria, significantly enhances the mobilization of Ra into waters.

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Hydrogeochemistry of thermal and mineralized waters in the Diyadin (Agri) area, Eastern Turkey	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; LAKE VAN; EVOLUTION; ANATOLIA; VOLCANISM; INITIATION; GENESIS; HELIUM	The Diyadin Geothermal area, located in the eastern part of Anatolia (Turkey) where there has been recent volcanic activity, is favorable for the formation of geothermal systems. Indeed, the Diyadin geothermal system is located in an active geodynamic zone, where strike-slip faults and tensional cracks have developed due to N-S regional compression. The area is characterized by closely spaced thermal and mineralized springs, with temperatures in the range 30-64 degrees C, and flowrates 0.5-10 L/s. Thermal spring waters are mainly of Ca(Na)-HCO3 and Ca(Mg)-SO4 types, with high salinity, while cold groundwater is mostly of Ca(Na, Mg)-HCO3 type, with lower salinity. High contents of some minor elements in thermal waters, such as F, B, Li, Rb, Sr and Cs probably derive from enhanced water-rock interaction. Thermal water samples collected from Diyadin are far from chemical equilibrium as the waters flow upward from reservoirs towards spring vents and possibly mix with cooler waters. The temperatures of the deep geothermal reservoirs are estimated to be between 92 and 156 degrees C in Diyadin field, based on quartz geothermometry, while slightly lower estimates are obtained using chalcedony geothermometers. The isotopic composition of thermal water (delta O-18, delta H-2, delta H-3) indicates their deep-circulating meteoric origin. The waters are likely to have originated from the percolation of rainwater along fractures and faults to the deep hot reservoir. Subsequent heating by conduction due to the presence of an intrusive cupola associated with the Tendurek volcano, is followed by the ascent of deep waters to the surface along faults and fractures that act as hydrothermal conduits. Modeling of the geothermal fluids indicates that the fluid is oversaturated with calcite, aragonite and dolomite, which matches travertine precipitation in the discharge area. Likewise, the fluid is oversaturated with respect to quartz, and chalcedony indicating the possibility of siliceous precipitation near the discharge areas. A conceptual hydro-geochemical model of the Diyadin thermal waters based on the isotope and chemical analytical results, has been constructed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Waters come from a deep hydrogeological circuit, which is chiefly hosted in the carbonate rocks and evaporites belonging to the Upper Triassic Verbicaro Unit (Iannace et. al., 2007). In particular, the warm deep reservoir has a temperature of 45 degrees C, as indicated by the chalcedony solubility and the SO4-F geothermometers. The warm reservoir is probably located at depths close to 0.9 km, assuming a geothermal gradient of 33 degrees C km* Water leaves the deep reservoir discharges at the surface at 37.3 +/- 1.2 degrees C, with a SO4-Ca composition, after a relatively fast upflow and limited cooling. The upward part of hydrogeological circuit is controlled by local high angle fault systems as well as by the tectonic window of Sambiase, where the Verbicaro Unit crops out.

J	Saibi, H				Saibi, Hakim			Geothermal resources in Algeria	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Algeria; Geothermal; North Africa; Hot spring; Renewable energy	CENTRAL SAHARA; WEST-AFRICA; MEXICO; GRAVITY; BASINS	The geothermal resources in Algeria are of low-enthalpy type. Most of these geothermal resources are located in the northeastern of the country. There are more than 240 thermal springs in Algeria. Three geothermal zones have been delineated according to some geological and thermal considerations: (1) The Tlemcenian dolomites in the northwestern part of Algeria, (2) carbonate formations in the northeastern part of Algeria and (3) the sandstone Albian reservoir in the Sahara (south of Algeria). The northeastern part of Algeria is geothermally very interesting. Two conceptual geothermal models are presented, concerning the northern and southern part of Algeria. Application of gas geothermometry to northeastern Algerian gases suggests that the reservoir temperature is around 198 degrees C. The quartz geothermometer when applied to thermal springs gave reservoir temperature estimates of about 120 degrees C. The thermal waters are currently used in balneology and in a few experimental direct uses (greenhouses and space heating). The total heat discharge from the main springs and existing wells is approximately 642 MW. The total installed capacity from producing wells and thermal springs is around 900 MW.

Natural pollutants of Northern Lake Baikal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Natural pollutants; Hot spring; Acidic cold spring; Water chemistry; Speciation; Chemical anomaly	OIL; SPRINGS; CANADA; WATERS; BOTTOM	Hot and cold springs in the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal are investigated as natural pollutants of the lake, which can interfere with its chemistry. The study includes chemical analyses of lake water samples from different depths in the North Baikal basin, as well as waters of hot and cold onshore springs, and Baikal tributaries collected in 2007 through 2013. Thermal waters in the shore of Lake Baikal have much higher SO4, Cl, F, Na, and SiO2 concentrations than those in the lake water, as well as ten to hundred times greater enrichments in Li, Rb, Cs, Ga, As and W. Mineral water in cold springs is generally similar to the Baikal water with respect to total dissolved solids (TDS) and major-and trace-element chemistry. However, the Milky cold spring discovered in the lower reaches of the B. Cheremshan River within a few km from the lake stands out in its unusual Ca-Mg-SO4 composition, low pH (3.57) and high TDS (535 mg/l), and trace-element enrichments in Al, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Y, and REE. The concentrations of these elements are still higher, up to one or two orders of magnitude, in suspended solids abundant in the spring water. This water composition is typical rather of mine drainage in sulfide mineralization provinces and prompts the existence of a sulfide orebody in the area. Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Cd occur in the dissolved form, and their concentrations in stream water near the B. Cheremshan inlet into Baikal are only slightly lower than immediately downstream of the spring; REE and Y are ten times lower because of precipitation from the river water. However, all metals the spring water leaches from the surrounding rocks eventually end up in Lake Baikal. Although the spring has much greater enrichments relative to the Baikal water in a number of elements, it hardly can cause any significant change to the lake composition. Only local chemical anomalies of Mn, Al, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, REE and Y can be expected in the bottom sediments where the lake uptakes the B. Cheremshan stream.	[Sklyarov, E. V.; Sklyarova, O.

Geochemical evidence of seawater intrusion into a coastal geothermal field of central Greece: example of the Thermopylae system	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Groundwater in Mediterranean Countries	APR 24-28, 2006	Malaga, SPAIN			geochemistry; PHREEQC; sea-water intrusion; thermal water; Greece	DRAINAGE DEVELOPMENT; ACTIVE TECTONICS; RESIDENCE TIME; SPRINGS; ORIGIN	Thermal water of Thermopylae and from other geothermal fields located in the southern part of the Sperchios basin (central Greece) are characterized by high salinity (total dissolved salts, or TDS, range from 1.2 to 30.3 g L-1) associated with a degassing of CO2. To determine the mineralization processes, geochemical and isotopic investigations (major elements, O-18, H-2 and C-13) have been carried out upon 17 thermal waters from springs and boreholes. This study emphasizes that all the thermal waters result from the mixing of a seawater end-member, several fresh water components depending on the field location, and a mantle-derived CO2 rising upward through an E-W fault system. The seawater identified in the thermal mixture is likely to be evolved Aegean seawater (ASW). Once intruded into the basin sediments, the trapped seawater has its chemical content modified by both water-rock interactions and massive dissolution of the deep CO2 (pCO(2) of 100.5 atm). The modelling performed with PHREEQC indicates that the anomalous major ion ratios measured in the so-called evolved ASW are explained by the dissolution of calcite and dolomitization process associated to precipitation of gypsum within the thermal aquifer.

Nowadays, when mankind is facing increase in prices and gradual exhaustion of fossil fuel (oil, natural gas and coal), a turn to renewable energy resources, to which thermal water also belongs, is inevitable. Due to its natural features the Ovcar Banja Spa has been the target of geological and hydrogeological explorations aiming to determinate the most rational way of water potential. Thermal waters of the Ovcar Banja Spa occur in the form of a seepage spring along the bed of the Zapadna Morava river. Thermal water occurrence is characterised by linear distribution, which is the consequence of a regional fault zone of the strike northwest-south east. The water temperature increase of 15.2 degrees C has been recorded along this strike in the southeast, then 17.4 degrees C and, up to 37.8 degrees C in a dug well in the northwest. It is important to say that in the drill hole at the 48m depth of karst aquifer is measured the heat of 60 degrees C, which is important indicator of presence of geothermal energy. The high quality of groundwater, prospective conditions of sanitary protection and good infrastructure are of special significance to this area from the aspect of tapping and multi-purpose exploitation (balneological, wellness and sports-recreation purposes). Because of lack information on exact amounts of thermomineral water for its multipurpose utilisation, we propose drilling the new test production well based on geological and hydrogeological maps of investigation area, which can give us more information about karst aquifer of Ovcar Banja Spa.

Thermal tolerances of fishes occupying groundwater and surface-water dominated streams	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						diel refugia; spring-fed stream; stream fish; critical thermal maxima; temperature response	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; HYDROLOGIC CLASSIFICATION; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; FLUCTUATING TEMPERATURE; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; UNITED-STATES; LIMITS; TROUT; ACCLIMATION	A thermal tolerance study mimicking different stream environments could improve our ecological understanding of how increasing water temperatures affect stream ectotherms and improve our ability to predict organism responses based on river classification schemes. Our objective was to compare the thermal tolerances of stream fishes of different habitat guilds among 3 exposure periods: critical thermal maximum (CTmax, increase of 2 degrees C/h until loss of equilibrium [LOE] and death [D]), and 2 longer-term treatments (net daily increase of 1 degrees C) that mimicked spring-fed (SF; 4 degrees C daily increase) and non-spring-fed (NSF; 8 degrees C daily increase) conditions. Fishes in the pelagic habitat guild had a 1 degrees C higher average CTmax than benthic fishes. Thermal responses of species depended on exposure period with higher and increased variation in tolerances associated with the SF and NSF exposure periods. Logperch, Orangebelly Darter, Orangethroat Darter, and Southern Redbelly Dace were more sensitive to thermal increases regardless of SF or NSF treatment than were the 3 remaining species (Brook Silverside, Central Stoneroller, and Redspot Chub), which represented average thermal responses among the species tested. The 3 species that had a higher thermal response to CTmax-D (lethal endpoint of death) also were able to increase their tolerances more than other species in both SF and NSF treatments. Our data indicate finer guild designations may be useful for predicting thermal-response patterns. A diel thermal refuge increases the thermal responses of ectotherms to daily maxima, but the patterns across our SF and NSF treatments were similar suggesting minimum refuge temperatures may be more important than maximums. Nonetheless, stream temperature cooling over a 24-h period is important to ectotherm thermal tolerances, a result suggesting that sources of cooler water to streams might benefit from protection.

For these reasons, our main hypotheses were: i) to the constant water temperature benthic species will response by specific voltinism and life-cycle length will be different from those that the species usually have in non-spring habitats; ii) under the constant water temperature the particular species and whole community will have higher biomass turnover like in similar non-spring habitats. Investigation was performed in large cave karst spring "Vyvieranie" in the Western Carpathians. In total, 40 species of benthic macroinvertebrates were identified in the studied karst spring. The trajectory of the annual change of the benthic community structure clearly showed a returnable pattern at the species density and biomass level. The constant water temperature throughout the year was reflected by specific life-history trajectories in certain benthic species. While some species had fixed voltinism (e.g. Ephemerella mucronata, Isoperla sudetica), others indicated having a flexible life-cycle pattern. In the species with a flexible life cycle, the trajectory of larval development occurred in two different ways. In the first case, a constant water temperature extended larval development (e.g. Protonemura auberti, Leuctra albida). In the second case, the addition of a winter cohort was recorded (e.g. Gammarus fossarum, Rhyacophila tristis, Protonemura austriaca). The productivity of this benthic community was considerably higher than that previously found in other submountain limestone streams in the Western Carpathians.

The temperatures in the spring are the highest recorded for any thermal spring in Ireland (maximum of 25 degrees C). The temperature is elevated with respect to average Irish groundwater temperatures (9.5-10.5 degrees C), and represents a geothermal energy potential, which is currently under evaluation. A multi-disciplinary investigation based upon an audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) survey, and hydrochemical analysis including time-lapse temperature and chemistry measurements, has been undertaken with the aims of investigating the provenance of the thermal groundwater and characterising the geological structures facilitating groundwater circulation in the bedrock. The three-dimensional (3-D) electrical resistivity model of the subsurface at Kilbrook spring was obtained by the inversion of AMT impedances and vertical magnetic transfer functions. The model is interpreted alongside high resolution temperature and electrical conductivity measurements, and a previous hydrochemical analysis. The hydrochemical analysis and time-lapse measurements suggest that the thermal waters have a relatively stable temperature and major ion hydrochemistry, and flow within the limestones of the Carboniferous Dublin Basin at all times. The 3-D resistivity model of the subsurface reveals a prominent NNW aligned structure within a highly resistive limestone lithology that is interpreted as a dissolutionally enhanced strike-slip fault, of Cenozoic age. The karstification of this structure, which extends to depths of at least 500 m directly beneath the spring, has provided conduits that facilitate the operation of a relatively deep hydrothermal circulation pattern (likely estimated depths between 560 and 1000 m) within the limestone succession of the Dublin Basin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the winter thermal maximum and simultaneous increased discharge at Kilbrook spring is the result of rapid infiltration, heating and re-circulation of meteoric waters within this structurally controlled hydrothermal circulation system. This paper illustrates how AMT may be useful in a multi-disciplinary investigation of an intermediate-depth (100-1000 m), low-enthalpy, geothermal target, and shows how the different strands of inquiry from a multi-disciplinary investigation may be woven together to gain a deeper understanding of a complex hydrothermal system.

Aquatic biota in hot water: thermal gradients in rheocrene hot spring discharges as analogues for the effects of climate warming	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Thermophilic; rheocrene; thermal tolerance; crenobiology; travertine	TEMPERATURE; CYANOBACTERIAL; RESPONSES; QUALITY; REGIMES; STREAMS	Hot springs are characterised by water temperatures above 36.7 degrees C. Temperature decreases with distance in flow away from spring vents; this natural gradient provides a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of water temperature on aquatic biota. This study investigated the relationship between water temperature and the aquatic invertebrates and benthic diatoms in outflows from a hot spring complex in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Water temperature ranged from 62.7 degrees C at the vents to 26.0 degrees C at the location furthest downstream. Richness of benthic diatoms and aquatic invertebrates increased linearly in response to decreasing temperature, with no species present in the hot vents. Multivariate analysis showed that both community assemblages had a response to the temperature gradient. A drop in aquatic invertebrate richness and a change in assemblage composition occurred between 40 degrees C and 42 degrees C, indicating a threshold at this temperature. The nearby Einasleigh River has experienced several contemporary peaks in water temperature over 40 degrees C, which corresponds to this threshold level. The relationships indicate that consistent increases in water temperature expected under climate change could decrease biological richness and precipitate changes in the aquatic invertebrate and benthic diatom taxa of tropical aquatic ecosystems.

The plumbing system of the Pagosa thermal Springs, Colorado: Application of geologically constrained geophysical inversion and data fusion	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Electrical resistivity tomography; Inversion; Geothermal field; Hot springs	ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; UNZEN VOLCANO; CONDUCTIVITY; GRAVITY; FAULTS; JAPAN; MT	Fault and fracture networks usually provide the plumbing for movement of hydrothermal fluids in geothermal fields. The Big Springs of Pagosa Springs in Colorado is known as the deepest geothermal hot springs in the world. However, little is known about the plumbing system of this hot spring, especially regarding the position of the reservoir (if any) or the position of the major tectonic faults controlling the flow of the thermal water in this area. The Mancos shale, a Cretaceous shale, dominates many of the surface expressions around the springs and impede an easy recognition of the fault network. We use three geophysical methods (DC resistivity, self-potential, and seismic) to image the faults in this area, most of which are not recognized in the geologic fault map of the region. Results from these surveys indicate that the hot Springs (the Big Spring and a warm spring located 1.8 km further south) are located at the intersection of the Victoire Fault, a major normal crustal fault, and two north-northeast trending faults (Fault A and B). Self-potential and DC resistivity tomographies can be combined and a set of joint attributes defined to determine the localization of the flow of hot water associated with the Eight Miles Mesa Fault, a second major tectonic feature responsible for the occurrence of warm springs further West and South from the Big Springs of Pagosa Springs.

Although the thermal waters have a minimal influence on the yield of aquifers systems, these resources have a great socio-economic value, being widely used for various rheumatologic, dermatologic and psychiatric treatments. Our study aims to characterize the physicochemical parameters and geothermal properties of El Hamma hydrothermal systemin northeastern Algeria. We collected twelve water samples during April 2019 to identify the origin of the thermal groundwater and to evaluate the reservoir temperature in the geothermal system; based on major chemical constituents concentrations, saturation indices, and chemical geothermometer temperatures. We measured temperature, pH, and electric conductivity (EC) conventionalparameters. The temperature of the thermal water sample reaches 52.8 degrees C, the pH is slightly alkaline, with EC up to 3100 mu S/cm. We applied the diagram program to determine the hydrochemical facies, and the equilibrium state of the solid/liquid phase. We used Geothermometers to determine the origin, and temperature at depth of thermal waters. The facies are chlorinated and sodium sulphates; which is mainly related to the dissolution of evaporitic minerals and the weathering of silicates. The geothermometers have given temperatures ranging from 80.73 degrees C to 126.63 degrees C for the thermal reservoir. The results have identified the Jurassic limestone at more than 2300 m depths as the main thermal reservoir. Moreover, the application of the International Institute for Geothermal Research (IIRG) diagrams to the hot waters has shown a "gamma" diagram type, leading to confirm that the hot solutions are of deep origin, with waters circulating in the basement and carbonate formations.

Although limited to thermal springpools and outflows, desert dace were found in temperatures ranging from 37 degrees C near spring sources to 13 degrees C in downstream areas. Between May 1988 and October 1989, most of the discharge from a major spring outflow was diverted from its natural channel into an irrigation ditch, Trap catches in the original channel were reduced after the diversion, and fish densities were lower in die ditch than in the channel. Reduced fish numbers still persist (1996), even though the affected site has been relatively undisturbed since 1989. To improve desert dace habitat and increase populations, irrigation diversion should be discontinued and water returned to the original channel. Continued protection and increased habitat preservation for desert dace are recommended because of their limited distribution, apparently restricted habitat requirements, and the potential for environmental disruption in the urea.

They also sustain spring-dependent ecosystems and provide water flow to downstream ecosystems. We investigated the major element hydrogeochemistry of traditional springs, CO2-rich waters, and hot spas in South Korea and their relationships with features of bedrock geology and structural settings at the national scale to classify water types and identify the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type. Three criteria-mineral content, CO2(aq), and water temperature-defined six major water types. Alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks and sedimentary rocks result from readily weatherable lithology. The majority of mineralized waters are CO2-rich or thermal waters with a wide range of mineral contents. Their occurrence was found to be mainly concentrated near faults and boundaries between Early to Middle Jurassic granitic rocks and other rocks of much older ages, and this pattern was quantitatively identified through proximity analysis. This finding indicates that younger granitic rocks provide sources of heat and deep-seated CO2, and faults link these deep sources to groundwater flow. Hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals, including feldspar and biotite, is likely to supply major and minor solutes including Mg2+, F-, and Fe to CO2-rich and thermal waters. F- concentration appears to be regulated by the saturation states of calcite and fluorite, and Mg2+ concentration in alkaline thermal water is driven by the formation of Mg-bearing secondary silicates. We demonstrated that natural mineral water in tectonically stable regions has diverse thermal and hydrogeochemical properties that are mainly controlled by their lithological and structural settings at the regional scale. These results may help elucidate the generation processes of natural mineral waters with high cultural and ecological values, leading to their sustainable use and protection.

Detailed descriptions of the springs location and their characteristics were given. According to their chemical composition, the springs were classified as fluoride-bicarbonate (Mogoysky) and bicarbonatesulfate (Shurindinsky) types with a high concentration of fluorine. This is explained by the interaction of infiltration waters with embedding rocks. A wide diversity of cyanobacteria (14 species of 7 genera) was revealed in the investigated springs. The development of cyanobacteria in microbial mats was observed at water outflows at the temperatures of 37.8 to 76.6A degrees C. Chlorophyll a was the predominant pigment in microbial mats of the studied springs, indicating predominance of cyanobacteria in the mat. Deposition of various pyrite forms, celestite (SrSO4), fluorite (CaF2), calcium carbonate, elemental sulfur, barite, and amorphous silica was found in microbial mats.	[Tsyrenova, D.

Here, we explore the geomicrobiology of a 4438-m-high spring which emanates similar to 70 degrees C-water from a boratic microbialite called Shivlinga. Due to low atmospheric pressure, the vent-water is close to boiling point so can entropically destabilize biomacromolecular systems. Starting from the vent, Shivlinga's geomicrobiology was revealed along the thermal gradients of an outflow-channel and a progressively-drying mineral matrix that has no running water; ecosystem constraints were then considered in relation to those of entropically comparable environments. The spring-water chemistry and sinter mineralogy were dominated by borates, sodium, thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, sulfide, bicarbonate, and other macromolecule-stabilizing (kosmotropic) substances. Microbial diversity was high along both of the hydrothermal gradients. Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea constituted >98%, similar to 1% and <1% of Shivlinga's microbiome, respectively. Temperature constrained the biodiversity at similar to 50 degrees C and similar to 60 degrees C, but not below 46 degrees C. Along each thermal gradient, in the vent-to-apron trajectory, communities were dominated by Aquificae/Deinococcus-Thermus, then Chlorobi/Chloroflexi/Cyanobacteria, and finally Bacteroidetes/Proteobacteria/Firmicutes. Interestingly, sites of >45 degrees C were inhabited by phylogenetic relatives of taxa for which laboratory growth is not known at >45 degrees C. Shivlinga's geomicrobiology highlights the possibility that the system's kosmotrope-dominated chemistry mitigates against the biomacromolecule-disordering effects of its thermal water.

Numerical modeling of the spring thermal bar and pollutant transport in a large lake	OCEAN MODELLING			English	Article						Thermal bar; Mathematical model; Temperature of maximum density; Numerical experiment; Lake Baikal	CIRCULATION; BAIKAL; HYDRODYNAMICS; WATERS	The spring riverine thermal bar phenomenon is investigated numerically on an example of Lake Baikal, and the spread of pollutants coming from the Selenga River is forecast using the 2.5 D non-hydrostatic model in the Boussinesq approximation. This hydrodynamic model takes into account the diurnal variability of the heat fluxes on the lake surface and the effects of wind and the Earth's rotation. The results of numerical modeling show that the variability of the total heat flux over 24 h plays a significant role in the variation of the thermal bar movement rate that contributes to the rapid mixing of impurities entering with river water.

Geochemical data and geothermal modelling indicate that springs originate from circulation of surface water to depths exceeding 3.8 km. This implies that in the deformed belt surface waters actively circulate through gas-prone shales at depth. These circulation systems appear largely controlled by naturally occurring anomalous high permeability pathways that original by unusual tectonic features. Such pathways provide direct connection between deep gasshale units and the shallow surface environment. This is observed by present day leakage of thermogenic gas and higher hydrocarbons to surface in spring waters. This leakage is partly attenuated by natural occurrence of methanotrophic microbial communities in the spring waters. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Sada, DW				Sada, Donald W.			Synecology of a springsnail (Caenogastropoda : Hydrobiidae) assemblage in a Western US thermal spring province	VELIGER			English	Article						spring ecology; Hydrobiidae; springsnail ecology; arid land wetlands	LIFE-HISTORY; ABUNDANCE; FISHES	Springsnails are numerically dominant members of benthic communities in many springs of western North America and Australia. Several studies have shown the influence of water chemistry on their abundance and distribution within springs, but little information exists regarding their use of physical aspects of spring environments. Habitat preferences, niche breadth and overlap, and environmental factors influencing the structure of an assemblage of native springsnails (Pyrgulopsis avernalis, P. carinifera, and Tryonia clathrata) and the non-native red-rimmed melania (Melanoides turberculata) gastropod are described in a southern Nevada, USA, thermal spring province. Water temperature, current velocity, and substrate type were the most important physical factors structuring the assemblage. Springbrook wetted width, presence of armored and incised banks, and location of sample sites across the wetted width were also statistically significant, but less important factors. Each species occupied a wide diversity of habitats, but each species also exhibited habitat preferences for a range of depths, velocities, temperatures, or substrates. Niche overlap varied among species and habitats were partitioned among species for a minimum of two environmental resources. Competitive interactions appeared to minimally influence the structure and distributions of species belonging to this assemblage. Findings suggest that springsnails are restricted to portions of a spring that provide suitable physicochemical conditions, and that each springsnail taxon may exhibit specific habitat requirements. Springsnail extinctions and declines in abundance in western North America and Australia can be attributed to human activities altering the discharge and water depth, substrate composition, current velocity, and water temperature of springs. Novel approaches are required to alter human uses and facilitate restoration, and protect the integrity of these unique and land aquatic systems.

Power generation output, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and exergy destruction were estimated for five working fluids by process calculation using HYSYS. When the basic conditions were as hot spring heat temperature of 60-140 degrees C, flow rate of the hot spring of 200 L/min, heat exchange temperature in the evaporator of 20 degrees C, temperature difference at pinch point of 5 degrees C, and i-butane as the working fluids, a difference in power generation output according to the working fluids was found at hot spring heat temperatures of 90 degrees C and above. In order to obtain 19 kW of power generation output, the exergy destruction of the power generation system was 27 kW, and the exergy destruction of the evaporator accounted for 44% of the whole. When groundwater or river water was used in the cooling process of the condenser, the power generation output was decreased by about 20% with the rise in circulating water temperature in summer.

Environmental response of a desert springbrook to incremental discharge reductions, Death Valley National Park, California, USA	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Desert spring; Temperature model; Threshold response; Aquatic habitat	INVERTEBRATES; ASSOCIATIONS; SPRINGSNAIL; STREAM	Desert springs are biodiversity hotspots that are easily altered by anthropogenic activities. Little is known about the effects of human disturbance on desert springs, and scarce information exists describing the environmental effects of incrementally increasing disturbance. The objective of this research was to quantify the influence of incremental reductions in discharge on the physical and thermal characteristics of a desert springbrook. In this study, the physical characteristics of a desert springbrook include hydraulic attributes that influence habitat availability, such as wetted area, flow velocity, and water depth. Thermal characteristics refer to water temperature and temperature gradients. The research objective was accomplished through a combination of field experiments at Travertine Spring, Death Valley National Park, USA, and hydraulic/temperature modeling to: (1) quantify changes in physical characteristics of the springbrook channel and aquatic environment; (2) investigate the effects of reduced spring discharge on seasonal spatial temperature patterns; (3) delineate tipping points that exhibit a non-linear response to decreased flow. We found that the physical environment changed with small decreases in discharge. Thermal tipping points were also exhibited due to decreases in discharge, but the magnitude of these responses was a function of distance from the spring source, seasonality, and temperature.

These beneficial effects of sulfurous water have been attributed to the presence of sulfurous compounds mainly in the form of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The purpose of the present study is to explore the effects of long-term exposure to sulfurous springs on oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers responses in individuals who lived nearby the sulfurous springs. The studied area was Al- Hammah sulfurous springs, which is located in the northern part of the Jordan Rift Valley and host many sulfurous springs. Residents in sulfurous springs area are continuously exposed to water and gases emission more than the overall population. We have found that the sulphate levels were 7 times higher in sulfurous springs water samples than control water samples. The majority of the volunteers involved in the present study were more than ten years long residence and lived in range distance between one to five kilometers (less than 3 miles) away from main sulfurous spring, and visited the sulfurous spring at least once a month. We did not find any noticeable symptoms in sulfur spring residents such as headaches, nausea, breathing problems. The total oxidative stress (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) in sulfurous spring residents were lower than control individuals. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total nitric oxide (NOx) levels were higher in sulfurous spring residents compared to control group. Furthermore, we have highlighted that living nearby the sulfurous springs does not affect oxygen saturation levels (SPO2) or heart pulse rate . These findings suggest that long-term exposure to sulfurous springs boost the antioxidant capacity and reduce oxidative stress levels in the human body. Hence, visiting sulfurous springs can act as natural remedies to diminish oxidative stress as they show promising potential in several-oxidative stress-related diseases treatment.

However, the local understanding of processes and factors controlling the high-temperature groundwater circulation remained undefined, which limits its exploitation. Following a brief review of SVZ, we address the previous issue by a hydrogeochemical and isotopic analysis of 15 thermal springs at Liquine area (representative of SVZ), supplemented by geochemical simulations. We demonstrate that fault zones and derived hydraulic properties have a predominant control on the ascending high-temperature groundwater circulation and hydrogeochemical processes. Spring discharges and outflowing temperatures are higher along the LOFS damage-zone and ATF than those along the LOFS fault core-zone. Albite dissolution is the main water-rock interaction that is enhanced by absorbed geothermal gases (H2S and CO2 in LOFS; CO2 in ATF). Trace element contents (Li, Rb, Cs, As, Mo) are influenced by hydraulic properties and geothermal gases within faults. Intrinsic hydraulic properties of fault zones, where damage-zone is more permeable than the core zone, affect the Li, Rb, Cs contents. While As and Mo solely differ according to the gases presence. Water stable isotopes point that steam heating processes enhance the hydrogeochemical reactions through the LOFS damage-zone and ATF, whereas only low-temperature processes occur through the LOFS core-zone. LOFS damage-zone and ATFs are great targets for the shallow geothermal resource exploitation. But simulations indicate an elevated risk of scaling with consequences on the operation plants due to silicate mineral precipitations. Finally, Liquine thermal springs provide interesting insights to respond to the current and future energy challenges in Central-South Chile.

Experience Gained on Direct Use of Low Enthalpy Energy in Hotel do Parque, S. Pedro do Sul, Portugal	WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY EARTH SCIENCES SYMPOSIUM (WMESS 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium (WMESS)	SEP 11-15, 2017	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	LAMA Energy Grp, LAMA Gas & Oil				Despite the high number of thermal flowing springs in Portugal mainland (up to 52 hot springs), ranging temperatures from 20 degrees C to 77 degrees C, and with significant water flow rate, few district heating system were implemented in Portugal. Here we present the Sao Pedro do Sul district heating system, located northern of Portugal. The thermal power plant was designed, completed, and commissioned in 2001 allowing the utilization of the geothermal heat by local users, as Hotel do Parque. The district heating system sums about 15 years of utilization without interruption and with minor drawbacks. On this paper we present the project overview along with thermal power plant specifications and data numbers. Heat comes from a 16.9 L/s of thermal water supplied by a natural spring and a nearby well. Heat from the spring and well sources is transferred to a secondary low mineralized water system by a plate heat exchanger, allowing the heating of space and domestic waters of hotel areas. Based on a theoretically cascade direct use of heat from a 67 degrees C to a 20 degrees C water temperature range, available heat totals 29.1*10(6) kWh yearly. However, past and actual use of heat only reaches around 1.6% of that figure. By comparing with fossil heat sources, actual use of a natural heat source reduces a theoretically amount of 117.9 ton of CO2 emissions by year. The successful use of this district heating system can promote local expansion of new users and other possible heat uses of this renewable energy, giving chance for the district heating system saturation.

J	Modabberi, S; Yekta, SSJ				Modabberi, Soroush; Yekta, Shirin-sadat Jahromi			Environmental geochemistry and sources of potentially toxic elements in thermal springs in the Sabalan volcanic field, NW Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Potentially toxic elements; Thermal springs; Environmental geochemistry; Hydrothermal system; Arsenic; Sabalan volcano; Iran	TRACE-ELEMENTS; HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS; HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION; GEOTHERMAL AREA; WATERS; GROUNDWATERS; ISLAND; SEBINKARAHISAR; SYSTEMS; NAPLES	Thermal springs are attractive geological features interesting for tourists because of their balneological and therapeutic applications. In Iran, the thermal springs surrounding Mount Sabalan are famous and unique in this regard. Two clusters of thermal springs consisting of 16 springs and mostly used as spas occur in Neer and Meshkinshahr areas. In order to investigate the seasonal changes of field and chemical parameters and to trace element concentrations in dry and wet seasons, springs were sampled twice in May and November. Field data including T, EC, pH and Q were measured on-site and major cations and anions were analysed in the laboratory along with 72 trace elements. Cations show the following order of abundance: Na a parts per thousand << Ca a parts per thousand yen K > Mg and anions follow the order of Cl > HCO3 > SO4. Trace element concentrations indicate that most of the elements show concentrations well beyond the standard guideline values for drinking water. pH, T, spring discharge and elevation are not correlated with each other and with other parameters, indicating that they have had no role on concentrating or depleting trace elements in spring waters. While the two sets of samples were taken within a 6 month interval, the elements and parameters show slight or no variation from the first period to the second and in some cases, they show less than 5 % decrease or increase in the second sampling period. Correlation coefficient and principal component analysis of analytical data indicate that EC, K, Cl, HCO3, As, B, Ba, Br, Li, Na, Rb, Sr and V show very strong mutual correlation coefficients implying their relationship and common source and fate in the hydrothermal fluid that carries them out of the geothermal system. Moreover, they all fall in the component 1 of PCA. This group of elements is supposed to be derived from the magmatic-hydrothermal system through the interaction of hydrothermal fluids with the rocks they have passed through. The mean As value is 160-fold higher than the guideline values (10 mu g/l) and Mn and Sb shows an exceedance of 12- and 11.5-fold, respectively. Arsenic shows a variation of 5-5,834 mu g/l. Hence, it is supposed that potentially toxic elements may have adverse effects on tourists using the springs as a treatment or recreation. Indeed, the discharge of springs with high values of As and other elements represents a threat for downstream water uses. The higher concentrations of most elements including As, Pb, S, Cl and Sb and the higher pH values found in Neer area springs seem to be more related to an older hydrothermal system present in this area than the Meshkinshahr system that is still active today.

In this work, two thermal springs in the east of Algeria have been chosen to assess the activity concentration of natural radionuclide, mainly the three natural radioactive series U-238, U-235 and Th-232, and (40) K. The high- resolution gamma ray spectroscopy was used to determine these concentrations. In these water samples, U-235, Th-234, Pb-210, Ra-226 radionuclides are less than the minimum detectable activity. The activity of U-238 is dominant. The U-238 activity was determined by taking the mean activity of two separate photo-peaks of daughter nuclides Pb-214 at 351.92 (37.2%) keV and Bi-214 at 609.31 (45%) keV. The measured activity concentrations of U-238 in water samples obtained from the concentrations of Bi-214 and Pb-214 ranged from 0.56 +/- 0.20 to 1.13 +/- 0.20 Bq/L. The annual effective dose value due to the ingestion of the measured radionuclide U-238 in 1 L of water, for an adult, ranged from 9.20 to 18.56 mu Sv.

Analysis of turbulent nonisothermal mixing between a jet and cooler ambient water using thermal imagery	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Cascades; infrared video; hot springs; mixing; plume; turbulence	BUOYANT SURFACE DISCHARGES; HYDROTHERMAL PLUMES; INTEGRAL MODEL; ENTRAINMENT; OCEAN; DYNAMICS; BODIES; RIDGE; VENT; FLOW	We apply turbulence analysis techniques to high-frequency (16 Hz), high-resolution (1.5 mm pixels) thermal infrared images to analyze spatial and temporal scales of mixing between discharging hot spring water (similar to 60 degrees C) and a stream (similar to 10 degrees C) at Breitenbush Hot Springs, Oregon. Optical flow velocimetry of the images provides insight to the transient two-dimensional flow fields of the plumes; correlation of these data sets through space and time indicates the timescales and length scales of turbulent structures within the mixing fluids. We positioned the 7.5 cm diameter discharge pipe so that hot spring water exited along either the surface or bottom of the 15 cm deep stream, conditions hereafter referred to as "shallow" or "deep." During shallow discharge, hot water exits as a jet with length scales of similar to 15 cm. During deep discharge, hot water reaches the surface as a region with similar to 15 cm length scale similar to 20 cm downstream of the inlet. The average temperatures and ratio of thermal variation to turbulent timescale provide a measure of mixing intensity and a means of comparing mixing rates throughout the region of interest. Lateral mixing at the surface dominates during shallow discharge, whereas the most efficient mixing during deep discharge occurs beneath the surface. The largest eddy diffusivities in both scenarios occur downstream of the jet and rising plume, suggesting that those structures must break apart for efficient mixing to occur. The coupled use of thermal imaging technology and optical velocimetry permits quantitative analysis of turbulent mixing in the field at a level of detail rarely achieved.

As each degree of oxidation of elemental S corresponds to a different S species, sulphurous spring waters may contain a variety of S species. Total S content is one of the parameters measured when analysis is carried out for issuing a spa's operating licence. Under French law these parameters must be stable over time. The two spas in Aix-les-Bains are fed by a number of natural springs and boreholes, whose waters have total reduced S concentrations of between 30 and 800 mg L-1. To ensure compliance with the requirements of the spas' operating licences, particularly in terms of total reduced S content, official analysis of the waters is carried out every month at random dates and times. Monthly analyses have revealed seasonal variations in the S content of some of Aix-les-Bains' springs; therefore, more frequent monitoring was carried out in order to investigate the extent and causes of these fluctuations. As well as seasonal variations, this monitoring has revealed daily and hourly fluctuations that appear to be related to extraction rates. For some of the springs and borcholes, S concentrations were correlated with extraction rates; for others, an increase in extraction rate led to a reduction in total S content. Concentrations of sulphide ions (one of the species included in the total sulphur analyses) were monitored at the same time as the total S content. Variations in sulphide ion concentrations and in sulphide concentration/total S ratios did not appear to be linked to variations in flow rate. These tests show that random monthly testing is not suitable for monitoring the stability of S contents, as this parameter can only be considered stable in terms of its yearly mean value.

Hydrogeothermal potentials of Rogozna mountain and possibility of their valorization	OPEN GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						geothermal energy; hydrogeothermal potential; use potential; spa; Rogozna Mountain; Serbia	THERMAL-MINERAL SPRINGS; GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; WORLDWIDE; REGION; SYSTEM; AREAS	The subjects of this study are hydrogeothermal potentials of Rogozna mountain (Serbia) and possibility of their use. Thermo-mineral springs at the mountain's foothill are the leftovers from an intensive volcanic activity during the Tertiary. The most famous and the most valuable ones are the springs in Novopazarska Spa, Banjska and in the village of Vuca, with a number of springs yet to be examined. The hydrogeothermal potential of these springs is significant, with the total thermal power of 4.6 MWt and the thermal energy of 145.4 TJ/year, but these could be greatly enlarged through the additional investigation in the interior of Rogozna. It is believed that the primary reservoir lies at the approximate depth of 2 km and that the water temperature is about 120 degrees C. In the area of Rogozna mountain there are a lot of thermomineral springs (TM) with outlet temperature between 30 and 54 degrees C. The main goal of this study is to determine the thermo-mineral capacity and energy potential in the area of three spas. This study allows the hypothesis that thermo-mineral springs in the area of Rogozna mountain have large potential. The researched area of Rogozna mountain is insufficiently investigated geo-space, which is rich in thermo-mineral springs. Thermal sources in Rogozna mountain produce heat power of 4.6MWt or 1.4% of heat power given by all the sources in Serbia. The waters of these springs are solely used for balneological and recreational purposes. Yet they could successfully be used in warming and cooling the space, for greenhouses in fruit, vegetable and flower production. In the end, all geospatial data with the help of GIS advanced techniques were digitized and visualized.

The investigation covered a survey area of 6075 m(2). Self-potential (SP), ground temperature and soil carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were measured and investigated for their distribution characteristics and inter-linkages. Results indicated obvious anomalous zone at the hot spring discharge site. The SP profile analysis highlighted thermal water upwelling zones and elevation-driven subsurface groundwater pathways. Measurement of subsurface temperatures up to 1 m depths revealed increasing temperatures, indicating potentially high thermal gradients in the area. Surface soil CO2 distributions also agreed with SP and ground temperature results. The overall result of the study demonstrated that synchronised measurements of SP, ground temperature and soil CO2 can be instrumental in identifying anomalous zones near the hot spring sites. Other parameters such as spring water temperature, discharge rate and energy flux estimates from the spring were calculated and analysed. The high-dense multi-parameter data coverage allowed interpretation of geothermal features at a scale never conducted in Fiji before. The near-surface investigations reported in this study corroborate previously suggested steady geothermal activity in the region, deserving further detailed investigation.

The origin and transport of spring waters from which travertines precipitate are elucidated by chemical and isotopic studies of the travertines and associated thermal springs and gas vents. There are consistent differences in the geochemical and isotopic signatures of thermal spring waters, gas vents and present and fossil travertines between east and west of the Tiber Valley. West of the Tiber Valley, delta(13)C of CO2 discharged from gas vents and delta(13)C of fossil travertines are higher than those to the east. To the west the travertines have higher strontium contents, and gases emitted from vents have higher He-3/He-4 ratios and lower N-2 contents, than to the east. Fossil travertines to the west have characteristics typical of thermogene (thermal spring) origin, whereas those to the east have meteogene (low-temperature) characteristics (including abundant plant casts and organic impurities). The regional geochemical differences in travertines and fluid compositions across the Tiber Valley are interpreted with a model of regional fluid flow. The regional Mesozoic limestone aquifer is recharged in the main axis of the Apennine chain, and the groundwater flows westward and is discharged at springs. The travertine-precipitating waters east of the Tiber Valley have shallower flow paths than those to the west. Because of the comparatively short fluid flow paths and low (normal) heat flow, the groundwaters to the east of the Tiber Valley are cold and have CO2 isotopic signatures, indicating a significant biogenic contribution acquired from soils in the recharge area and limited deeply derived CO2. In contrast, spring waters west of the Tiber Valley have been conductively heated during transit in these high heat-flow areas and have incorporated a comparatively large quantity of CO2 derived from decarbonation of limestone. The elevated strontium content of the thermal spring water west of the Tiber Valley is attributed to deep circulation and dissolution of a Triassic evaporite unit that is stratigraphically beneath the Mesozoic limestone. U-series age dates of fossil travertines indicate three main periods of travertine formation (ka): 220-240, 120-140 and 60-70. Based on the regional flow model correlating travertine deposition at thermal springs and precipitation in the recharge area, we suggest that pluvial activity was enhanced during these periods. Our study suggests that travertines preserve a valuable record of paleofluid composition and paleoprecipitation and are thus useful for reconstructing paleohydrology and paleoclimate.

On the premise of ensuring the backward motion of the piston toward its initial position, the smallest elasticity coefficient of a spring is adopted to diminish the degree of thermal hysteresis.

The integration of thermal infrared imaging, discharge measurements and numerical simulation to quantify the relative contributions of freshwater inflows to small estuaries in Atlantic Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						groundwater discharge; estuaries; airborne thermal infrared imaging; springs; hydrograph separation; groundwater modelling	SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; WAQUOIT BAY; NITROGEN; CONSEQUENCES; SEEPAGE; CARBON	Nutrient fluxes from developed catchments are often a significant factor in the declining water quality and ecological functioning in estuaries. Determining the relative contributions Of Surface water and groundwater discharge to nutrient-sensitive estuaries is required because these two pathways may be characterized by different nutrient concentrations and temporal variability, and may thus require different remedial actions. Quantifying the volumetric discharge of groundwater, which may occur via diffuse seepage or springs, remains a significant challenge. In this contribution, the total discharge of freshwater, including groundwater, to two small nutrient-sensitive estuaries in Prince Edward Island (Canada) is assessed using a unique combination of airborne thermal infrared imaging, direct discharge measurements in streams and shoreline springs, and numerical simulation of groundwater flow. The results of the thermal infrared surveys indicate that groundwater discharge Occurs at discrete locations (springs) along the shoreline of both estuaries, which can be attributed to the fractured sandstone bedrock aquifer. The discharge measured at a sub-set of the springs correlates well with the area of the thermal signal attributed to each discharge location and this information was used to determine the total spring discharge to each estuary. Stream discharge is shown to be the largest volumetric contribution of freshwater to both estuaries (83% for Trout River estuary and 78% for McIntyre Creek estuary); however, groundwater discharge is significant at between 13% and 18% of the total discharge. Comparison of the results from catchment-scale groundwater flow models and the analysis of spring discharge Suggest that diffuse seepage to both estuaries comprises only about 25% of the total groundwater discharge. The methods employed in this research provide a useful framework for determining the relative volumetric contributions of surface water and groundwater to small estuaries and the findings are expected to be relevant to other fractured sandstone coastal catchments in Atlantic Canada.

New data on major components, selected trace elements (Li, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr, Fe, Al), water isotopic composition (H, O and S), chemical and isotopic (delta C-13 of CO2 and CH4, He-3/He-4 and Ar-40/Ar-36) composition of dissolved and bubbling gases from the hottest vents are presented. Four groups of springs with temperature range of 27-44 degrees C discharge Ma-CI waters with total dissolved solids (TDS) of similar to 800 to similar to 7000 mg/L from different aquifers composed of diverse type of rocks including granites and limestone. Only the hottest and most saline springs of the Bazman field with low bicarbonate are close to equilibrium with surrounding rocks whereas the others discharge immature waters. Geothermometry based on Sio(2) concentrations, Na-K and Na-K-Ca-Mg systems shows low equilibrium temperatures of up to 130 degrees C, consist with the temperatures estimated by alumino-silicate minerals saturation indices. The water isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D) indicates meteoric origin with a small oxygen isotopic shift measured in the saline waters. The delta S-34 values of SO4 indicate influence of gypsum and anhydrite dissolution from the host rock. Dissolved and free gases are N-2-rich (>95 vol.%) with a high He content (0.5 vol.%). A biogenic origin may be suggested for CH4 and CO2 based on their carbon isotopic characteristics (-62%. and -13%. vs. V-PDB, respectively). The R/Ra value of 0.5 indicates a contribution of about 6 % of He from the mantle. It is suggested that the Bazman thermal waters are heated at considerable depth (4-5 km) in a deep fault system most probably by the regional heat flow according to the local geothermal gradient.

J	de Carvalho, AM; Duarte, MCT; Ponezi, AN				de Carvalho, Adriana Moneira; Teixeira Duarte, Marta Cristina; Ponezi, Alexandre Nunes			Quality assessment of sulfurous thermal waters in the city of Pocos de caldas, Minas gerais, Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Sulfurous hot springs water; Water quality; Physical-chemical analysis; Pocos de Caldas; MG-Brazil		Currently, the quality of the water consumed by the population, and also the water used for both leisure and therapeutic bathing, are known. In the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the population has two sources of sulfurous thermal water, with free access for various purposes, including drinking. Since 1882, the system has retained the same structural characteristics, and at this time, there appears to be a risk of anthropogenic contamination due to population increase near the springs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality of the sulfurous hot springs distributed in Pedro Botelho fountain, located in Thermas Antonio Carlos, and Monkey fountain, located in Mario Mourao bathhouse, for microbiological and bacteriological components, physical and chemical composition, and radio-nuclides for a period of 12 months and to compare their quality with Brazilian water quality laws. The results showed that all the values are within the prescribed water quality parameters, except fluoride and sodium, whose levels are above those permitted by law. Excess fluoride in consumed water can cause dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis. As for sodium, which exceeded the permissible limits by 20 to 25 %, it can be detrimental to hypertensive individuals. An important fact to consider is that water from sulfurous hot springs cannot be consumed without medical supervision because its chemical characteristics may cause damage to health, and it should only be used as medicinal mineral water.

A combination of methods, including hydrochemistry, stable and radioisotope composition, and structural analyses based on satellite data, provided information about the structure of the subsurface and the derived groundwater flow paths. Satellite images reveal karst features within the northern plateau, e.g. conical landforms. Karstic caves were documented along both escarpments. Chemical analysis of floodwater from Wadi Araba indicates higher concentrations of terrestrial salts compared to floodwaters from central and southern parts of the desert. delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures in spring waters resemble those of floodwater and fall on the global meteoric water line, confirming their fast infiltration with minor influence of evaporation. The aquifer feeding the springs of the Northern Galala Plateau has low retention and the springs dry out quickly, even after heavy rainfall. Contrastingly, H-3 activities in springs emerging from the Southern Galala Plateau refer to much slower subsurface passage. With respect to H-3 content (3.8 TU) in recent flood waters, the spring water at Southern Galala Plateau contains about 40% recently recharged groundwater. However, its largest spring-the St. Antony spring-discharges water with a radiocarbon age of about 15,000 years. In combination with this spring's constant and high discharge over a period of several months, that age estimate suggests a large reservoir with moderate to high retention.

Future availability of these refuges is in doubt; most of these power plants may be retired within the next 20 years and groundwater withdrawals for human use threaten natural springs. This article examines possible effects on manatees from losing major warm-water refuges and alternative management actions. Because of manatee site-fidelity patterns, plant retirements may increase cold-stress-related deaths and significantly decrease manatee abundance. A forward-looking management strategy is urgently needed before decisions are made to retire plants now used by large numbers of manatees. Possible management alternatives include: gradually weaning manatees off plant outfalls, maintaining the flow of springs now used by manatees, enhancing access to suitable warm-water springs now little used or unused by manatees, constructing new non-industry dependent warm-water refuges, and creating new thermal basins to retain warm-water pockets able to support overwintering manatees.

Simulating phytoplankton growth during the spring thermal bar in a deep lake	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Thermal bar; Plankton; Spring heating; Numerical modeling; Water density temperature; Lake Baikal	DYNAMICS; WATERS; BAIKAL; CIRCULATION; IMAGERY; FRONTS; RIVER; WIND	Phytoplankton growth in Lake Baikal was simulated during thermal bar events using meteorological data from June 1-30, 2017. Dynamics of the thermal bar and the plankton population were reproduced by the coupled physical-biological model that describes hydrodynamic processes and interactions of the components of the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus system. The key point of the model is consideration of atmospheric impact on the lake surface, taking into account the intraday variability of wind forcing and fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation and latent and sensible heat. Numerical modeling showed that a combination of cabbeling instability, associated with the thermal bar, and wind-driven currents lead to sinking of the phytoplankton biomass from the surface area to the lower layers of the lake. The increase in phytoplankton results in a degradation of the nutrients in the corresponding water environment. Simulations demonstrated that the maximum concentrations of phytoplankton are localized in the inshore side of the thermal bar. At the same time, the thermal bar acted as a barrier preventing the horizontal propagation of the biological substances into open waters. A comparative analysis of the calculated temperature and phytoplankton distributions with available field data was performed.

Assessing SGD flows and their impact on coastal marine environments is a difficult task, since it is not easy to identify and measure these water flows discharging into the sea. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the significant usefulness of the freely available thermal infrared (TIR) imagery of the Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) as an exploratory tool for identifying SGD springs worldwide, from local to regional scales, for long-term analysis. The use of satellite thermal data as a technique for identifying SGD springs in seawater is based on the identification of thermally anomalous plumes obtained from the thermal contrasts between groundwater and sea surface water. In this study, we use the TIR remote sensing (TIRRS) imagery provided by Landsat 8 at a regional scale and discuss the principle limiting factors of using this technique in SGD studies. The study was developed in karstic coastal aquifers in the Mediterranean Sea basin during different seasons and under diverse meteorological conditions. Although this study demonstrates that freely available satellite TIR remote sensing is a useful method for identifying coastal springs in karst aquifers both locally and regionally, the limiting factors include technical limitations, geological and hydrogeological characteristics, environmental and marine conditions and coastal geomorphology.

These waters, springing out from below ground and flowing into the hypersaline Dead Sea, form an isolated environment from a biogeographic point of view. We have investigated the molecular diversity of the cyanobacteria in the springs. The diversity discovered was large, defining operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by a cutoff of 97% similarity; 10 major OTUs were found, including an as yet unidentified cluster of cyanobacteria. The various patterns of similarities of our sequences to others obtained from different thermal environments worldwide led us to rethink the common theories in biogeography. Based on the data obtained, we suggest that there is no constant geographical separation of microorganisms; however, local speciation does occur at a rate dictated mainly by local community dynamics and the rate of entrance of new organisms into the ecosystem.

The bacterial diversity of the hot water springs was determined by pyrosequencing of the two 16S rRNA hypervariable regions V1-3 and V4-7. Analyses of the community DNA revealed that bacterial populations as detectable by the V1-3 or V4-7 region, respectively were dominated by the Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria for Mphephu, and Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria for both Tshipise and Sagole. The major differences in the bacterial diversity between the springs was that no Cyanobacteria were detected for Mphephu and the level of Bacteriodetes detected for both Tshipise and Sagole was much lower compared to the levels detected at Mphephu. The Firmicutes were detected at all the springs but at a much lower abundance compared to the other main phyla detected. Various other phyla were detected at the hot springs at levels below 0.20% of the total sequences obtained. It is interesting that very diverse bacterial genera exist in the three hot water springs studied.

This methodology has been applied to the Alhama Aquifer, which is the origin of the most important thermal springs of the Iberian Peninsula. A conceptual model was made of the aquifer by integrating data such as (1) the geometry at depth (on the basis of deep geophysics) and at the surface (from conventional geological maps); (2) hydrographic analysis of the aquifer discharge; (3) a study of the recharge by classic hydrometeorological methods; and (4) conventional and isotopic hydrochemistry. In addition to the hydraulic regional parameters it provides, the model explains the origin of the Alhama springs in terms of simple circulation at a depth of some 900 m and a normal geothermal gradient (3 degrees C/100 m), with no requirement of contact with a source of heat at the bottom of the aquifer.

Here we present the first study of prokaryotic and phage community dynamics in these environments. Phages were abundant in hot springs, reaching concentrations of a million viruses per milliliter. Hot spring phage particles were resistant to shifts to lower temperatures, possibly facilitating DNA transfer out of these extreme environments. The phages were actively produced, with a population turnover time of I to 2 days. Phage-mediated microbial mortality was significant, making phage lysis an important component of hot spring microbial food webs. Together, these results show that phages exert an important influence on microbial community structure and energy flow in extreme thermal environments.

A model for predicting common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) emergence in soybean	WEED SCIENCE			English	Article						growing degree days; hydrothermal time; soil temperature; soil thermal fluctuation; soil water potential; thermal time; weed emergence modeling	SEEDLING EMERGENCE; AMARANTHUS-RETROFLEXUS; ABUTILON-THEOPHRASTI; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; SETARIA-FABERI; WEED SEED; TEMPERATURE; CORN; PERIODICITY; GERMINATION	The objective of this research was to develop a model to predict common cocklebur seedling emergence in spring tillage and no-spring-tillage systems in the presence and absence of a soybean canopy. A Weibull function was used to accumulate heat units (i.e., growing degree days) at a 2.5 cm soil depth on days when mean soil temperature, soil water potential, and soil thermal fluctuation were above established thresholds. The base temperature, soil water potential, and soil thermal fluctuation thresholds used for model development were 17 C, -100 kPa, and 7.5 C, respectively. A single function adequately described common cocklebur seedling emergence in the presence and absence of drill-seeded soybean from data combined over an artificial (2004) and natural seedbank (2005) (R-2 = 0.986). Model parameterization differed between the artificial and natural seedbank in the absence of spring tillage, but emergence was adequately described, regardless of soybean presence. Separate parameter estimates for the artificial and natural seedbanks were needed to adequately describe emergence in the system without spring tillage (R2 = 0.975 to 0.984). The ability of the model to account for reduced emergence when soil moisture is limited or when daily thermal fluctuation requirements are not met could assist practitioners with assessments associated with field scouting for weeds as well as other management decisions.

Our objectives were to determine movement of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) that use thermal refuge and project differences in growth and consumption among smallmouth bass exhibiting different thermal-use patterns. We implanted radio transmitters in 29 smallmouth bass captured in Alley Spring on the Jacks Fork River, Missouri, USA, during the winter of 2012. Additionally, temperature archival tags were implanted in a subset of nine fish. Fish were tracked using radio telemetry monthly from January 2012 through January of 2013. The greatest upstream movement was 42.5km, and the greatest downstream movement was 22.2km. Most radio tagged fish (69%) departed Alley Spring when daily maximum river water temperature first exceeded that of the spring (14 degrees C) and during increased river discharge. Bioenergetic modelling predicted that a 350g migrating smallmouth bass that used cold-period thermal refuge would grow 16% slower at the same consumption level as a fish that did not seek thermal refuge. Contrary to the bioenergetics models, extrapolation of growth scope results suggested migrating fish grow 29% more than fish using areas of stream with little groundwater influence. Our results contradict previous findings that smallmouth bass are relatively sedentary, provide information about potential cues for migratory behaviour, and give insight to managers regarding use and growth of smallmouth bass in thermally heterogeneous river systems.

The hydrogeochemistry of thermal springs on Mutnovskii Volcano, southern Kamchatka	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY			English	Article							RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; GEOCHEMISTRY; MOBILITY; WATERS; REE	This paper reports results from a hydrogeochemical study of thermal springs on Mutnovskii Volcano. The solutions of boiling pots and the pore water of thermal localities in the Donnoe Field were found to have an anomalous composition over a wide range of chemical elements, including rare earth elements (REE) and platinum-group elements (PGEs). The solutions of different springs exhibit considerable variations in their major and minor element compositions, indicating differences in the generation and upward transport of solutions. Physicochemical modeling showed that the mud pots studied could have been formed when the separate was ascending along an open fissure channel from the secondary zone of mixed boiling fluids. The high concentrations of titanium, vanadium, chromium, nickel, cobalt, REEs, and PGMs suggest a deep-seated source for these. The chemical forms of the elements in the solutions (primarily free aquaions) and the acidic environment favor high mobility of these elements. Deposition and concentration of these elements under near-surface conditions is unlikely.	[Bortnikova, S.

The shift in the temperature preference we observed in smolting fall chinook but not spring chinook salmon may reflect a phylogenetic adaptation to summer emigration by (1) providing directional orientation as fall chinook salmon move into the marine environment, (2) maintaining optimal gill function during emigration and seawater entry, and/or (3) resetting thermoregulatory set-points to support physiological homeostasis once smolted fish enter the marine environment. Phylogenetically determined temperature adaptations and responses to thermal stress may not protect fall chinook salmon from the recent higher summer water temperatures, altered annual thermal regimes, and degraded cold water refugia that result from hydropower regulation of the Columbia and Snake rivers. The long-term survival of fall chinook salmon will likely require restoration of normal annual thermographs and rigorous changes in land use practices to protect critical thermal refugia and control maximum summer water temperatures in reservoirs.

In most of the springs the number of viable aerobes was less than 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and the number of sporulated bacteria less than 10(2) cfu ml(-1). No significant differences were found in the counts obtained with Plate Count Agar (PCA) and PCA diluted 1 : 10 and incubated at 22 degrees, 37 degrees and 45 degrees C. Total coliforms were found in 14 springs, faecal streptococci in three, spores of sulphite-reducing Clostridium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in seven. Neither Escherichia coli nor Staphylococcus aureus were found. A total of 665 strains were isolated and 85.4% of these identified; 329 were Gram-positive and 239 were Gram-negative. The genera most prevalent present in the springs were Pseudomonas (in 92.3%), Bacillus (65.4%), Enterobacter, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus (50%), Acinetobacter (42.3%), Arthrobacter (38.4%), Clostridium (27%) and Xanthomonas (23%). Gram-negative bacteria predominated in the mesothermal springs and Gram-positive bacteria in the hyper- and hypothermal springs. The mom common Gram-negative rod species isolated were Ps. fluorescens, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. putida, Ent. agglomerans, Ent. sakazakii, Ac. calcoaceticus and Ent. amnigenus.

According to the findings of various studies, high-throughput DNA sequencing technology can be utilized to perform more precise and detailed microbiome assessments. The main goal of this paper was to determine the microbiome in a thermal spring by metabarcoding environmental DNA obtained from four different sources and revealing how temperature and chemical composition affect the microbiome. This research also aimed to gather information that will aid in determining the best gene region and bioinformatic pipeline. The findings revealed a link between four different thermal springs' physicochemical parameters and microbial composition and we found various manipulable steps in this study. This research is also first comprehensive thermal spring metabarcoding study conducted in Turkey. One of the most significant challenges for detecting microbial life in thermal springs by conventional techniques such as culturing is these places' physicochemical (temperature, heavy metal content, pH, etc.) conditions. Data from several studies suggest that high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies can be used to perform more accurate and detailed microbiome analyses. The primary aim of this paper was to determine the microbiome in the thermal source by metabarcoding environmental DNA isolated from four different sources and reveal the reflection of differences caused by temperature and chemical content on the microbiome. DNA was extracted from water filtered with enclosed filters and using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. The results showed a correlation between physicochemical conditions and microorganism composition of four different thermal springs. Springs with extremely high temperature (89-90 degrees C) were dominated by hyperthermophiles such as Hydrogenobacter and Thermus, while a spring with a high temperature (52 degrees C) was dominated by thermophiles such as Thermoanaerobaculum and Desulfurispora, and a spring with a low temperature (26 degrees C) and high salinity was dominated by halophiles and sulfur-oxidizers such as Hydrogenovibrio and Sulfirimonas. With this research, we observed many manipulable steps according to the work of interest. This study sought to obtain data that will help decide the right gene region and choose the optimal bioinformatic pipeline.

Within this genus, a number of species are recognized as human pathogens, potentially causing Acanthamoeba keratitis, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, and chronic granulomatous lesions. In this study, 60 water samples were taken from four thermal spring recreation areas in southern Taiwan. We detected living Acanthamoeba spp. based on culture-confirmed detection combined with the molecular taxonomic identification method. Living Acanthamoeba spp. were detected in nine (15%) samples. The presence or absence of Acanthamoeba spp. in the water samples depended significantly on the pH value. The most frequently identified living Acanthamoeba genotype was T15 followed by T4, Acanthamoeba spp., and T2. Genotypes T2, T4, and T15 of Acanthamoeba, are responsible for Acanthamoeba keratitis as well as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, and should therefore be considered a potential health risk associated with human activities in thermal spring environments.

Arctic thermal springs provide an opportunity to study how environmental gradients can impose strong selective pressures on microbial communities and provide a continuum of niche opportunities. We use microscopic and molecular methods to conduct a survey of microbial community composition at Troll Springs on Svalbard, Norway, in the high Arctic. Microorganisms there exist under a wide range of environmental conditions: in warm water as periphyton, in moist granular materials, and in cold, dry rock as endoliths. Troll Springs has two distinct ecosystems, aquatic and terrestrial, together in close proximity, with different underlying environmental factors shaping each microbial community. Periphyton are entrapped during precipitation of calcium carbonate from the spring's waters, providing microbial populations that serve as precursors for the development of endolithic communities. This process differs from most endolith colonization, in which the rock predates the communities that colonize it. Community composition is modulated as environmental conditions change within the springs. At Troll, the aquatic environments show a small number of dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that are specific to each sample. The terrestrial environments show a more even distribution of OTUs common to multiple samples.

In this study, we examine the potential for mixing and re-equilibration by examining heat and fluid flow along crustal-scale faults in tectonic geothermal systems. Numerical modeling results indicate that maximum in situ temperatures could be under-predicted by up to 30% due to mixing of fluids that enter the fault at different depths. This, coupled with the depression of isotherms by downward groundwater flow in the hanging wall, could cause underestimates of maximum circulation depth of greater than 80% in extreme cases. Kinetics does not favor re-equilibration in the shallower portions of faults due to low temperatures and higher fluid velocities. However, in areas of deeper circulation or higher heat flow such reactions are possible.	[Ferguson, G.; Hindle, S.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR				Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR			Stromatolites forming in acidic hot-spring waters, North Island, New Zealand	PALAIOS			English	Article							ROTOKAWA GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM; IN-SITU SILICIFICATION; SILICA ONCOIDS; DRUMMOND BASIN; JAROSITE; MICROORGANISMS; SEDIMENTS; GOLD; FOSSILIZATION; PRECIPITATION	Small spicular, columnar, and blade-shaped stromatolites are common features of hot spring and geyser systems in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of North Island, New Zealand. These organosedimentary structures can grow in many settings, where coater temperature and pH vary widely. Although most common in neutral and alkaline waters, stromatolites also are forming in several acid-sulfate spring and geyser systems in the Waiotapu geothermal area and at Lake Rotokawa. Growth of these stromatolites is partly mediated by a biota that is dominated by fungi and locally, diatoms. When stromatolites from acidic thermal waters are compared with those from neutral and alkali waters, significant differences in, their biota and mineralogy are evident. The biota in stromatolites from the neutral and alkali waters is dominated by prokaryotic bacteria (including cyanobacteria), whereas stromatolites from acidic waters are dominated by eukaryotic fungi and to a lesser extent, diatoms. Stromatolites in the neutral and alkali thermal waters are formed almost entirely of opaline silica, with calcite laminae present in a few localities. Although stromatolites in the acidic systems also are composed mainly of opaline silica, they contain substantial amounts of kaolinite and, locally, sulfur and/or jarosite. In ancient thermal deposits it may be possible to distinguish stromatolites that grew in acidic waters from those that formed in neutral and alkali systems by considering their preserved biota and mineralogy.

Measurement of Spring Thermal Stratification in Lake Michigan with the GLUCOS Observing System	OCEANS 2009, VOLS 1-3	OCEANS-IEEE		English	Proceedings Paper	Oceans 2009 Conference	OCT 26-29, 2009	Biloxi, MS	Marine Technol Soc, IEEE Ocean Engn Soc			FRONTS	The GLUCOS buoy-based observing system was deployed in Lake Michigan off the coasts of Milwaukee and Shorewood, WI from April 8 to May 28, 2009 to measure the dynamics of spring stratification. Three radio-linked data acquisition Pioneer buoys were deployed at 20 in, 40 m and 60 m depths approximately 2.1 km, 6.1 km and 9.2 km from shore respectively. Each buoy was equipped with a temperature sensor string to measure the thermal profile and multiparameter sondes to measure temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, % saturation DO2, pH and chlorophyll fluoresence. The thermal front, identified by a 4 degrees C vertical isotherm known as the thermal bar, was clearly observed passing each buoy as it moved from shallow to deeper water as the spring wore on. Sonde measurements showed some correlations with the onset of thermal stratification. This paper presents the design of the thermal bar buoy array, the temperature profiles and sonde data and discusses future directions.	[Consi, T.

No legionellae were isolated from the spring water upstream the distribution system suggesting strongly that the thermal area was the probable source of these pathogens. L. pneumophila was present at high level in some samples, reaching values of 8.2 x 10(3) CFU/l at the site C. We observed a low diversity among the 18 isolated Legionella strains according to 16S DNA analysis, since only L. pneumophila and Legionella londiniensis were identified. All of the L. pneumophila strains belong to five serogroups (1, 4, 5, 6 and 8). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis identified various genotypes among these serogroups and showed that these strains had pulsotypes distinct from L. pneumophila present in the CNRL Legionella-database. These environmental strains showed higher tolerance to heat shock stress at 48 degrees C than L. pneumophila clinical strain, which may explain their presence in warm waters. Our data suggested that potential pathogen legionellae are present in Tunisian medicalized thermal spas and emphasized the importance of adopting control measures to prevent infection.

Kh; Chudnenko, K., V; Khromov, A., V			MODELING THE FORMATION OF FLUORIDE NITROGEN-RICH HOT SPRINGS IN THE WATER - CRYSTALLINE ROCK SYSTEM	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS			Russian	Article						nitrogen-rich hot springs; thermodynamic modeling; physicochemical interaction; compositions of model and natural solutions	MOLAL THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; THERMAL WATERS; MASS-TRANSFER; MINERALS; HYDROTHERMS; EQUILIBRIA; MECHANISMS; ZONE	Physicochemical interactions in the water - porphyrite system in conditions of formation of nitrogen-rich hot springs were studied using computer simulation. Compositions of model solutions during such interactions are determined by a combined influence of the compositions of primary and secondary rock minerals. In the investigated interaction range, the solution actively processes large quantities of the primary rock in favor of secondary minerals, while dissolved components are accumulated in small amounts in the solution itself, and therefore the salinity is low. The intervals of the formation of hydrosilicate, bicarbonate and sulfate sodium solutions are clearly distinguished in the process of irreversible hydrolytic transformation of porphyrite. In a certain range of interactions, the compositions of the model solutions are well comparable with the compositions of natural high-fluoride hot springs. Nitrogen-rich hot springs are strongly influenced by meteogenic factors detectable by detailed and/or sufficiently long-term observations. In deep and surface conditions, the model solutions and natural hot springs considerably differ in composition. Differences are hardly noticeable in the behavior of cations, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfates, but are strongly manifested in changes in the quantities of carbon and silicon compounds and transformations of their forms. These transformations explain the hitherto incomprehensibly different ratios of hydrocarbonate and carbonate ions and hydrosilicate ions and silicic acid both in different hydrothermal sources and in different analyses of hot springs in nature. The development of thermal waters in crystalline rocks is related to two types of heterogeneities that are typical for the development of geological bodies. The first heterogeneity is the disturbed continuity of rocks in fault zones of various orders, due to which groundwater can penetrate into these structures. The uneven distribution of anionic elements in space is another heterogeneity predetermining the groundwater composition and, in particular, accumulation of fluorine, which is confirmed by the results of geological studies, as well as the study of the formation of high-fluoride groundwaters (including thermal water) in various geological structures.

Despite the scarcity of water resources in the Valle de Iglesia, there have been few attempts to study these springs in any detail. In this study, > 50 springs are described, each characterised by small volcano-like mud structures up to 15 m tall. Hydrogeological and hydrochemical analyses of the groundwater system in the Valle de Iglesia were performed to improve our understanding of the subsurface water flow and of the connections between the subsurface water and the associated systems of faults and springs. Site measurements were made, and the concentrations of the main ions and trace elements were also determined by laboratory analysis of water samples. The samples obtained from the spring were rich in Na-HCO3-SO4 and Na-SO4-HCO3, but the surface water samples from the Agua Negra River were rich in Ca-SO4-HCO3. The temperature of the springs was in the range 20-45 degrees C. Both the temperatures and the ionic ratios are compatible with the presence of a deep hydraulic circulation system. The oxidation of sulphide minerals nearby the magmatic rocks and volcanic edifices causes the mobilisation of arsenic, which accumulates in the groundwater due to the low annual rainfall. The concentrations of arsenic in the spring water samples were therefore higher than the current limit set by the World Health Organisation, meaning that the water is not suitable for human consumption.

In this area, multipurposes utilization of groundwater coexists: several thermal springs and wells supply spas and public pools, cold and fresh water is used for irrigation and drinking-water. Starting from theoretical concepts, a management plan has been developed to ensure groundwater sustainability in response to the increased demand of withdrawal from thermal wells, by integrating previous hydrogeological studies, new investigations and a new finite-difference model. The most stringent constraints considered are: to maintain the quality of thermal and fresh waters, to limit the effects on the hydraulic equilibrium existing between overlapping aquifers, to ensure a significant flow to the natural thermal springs and the quality and flow rate of the spring used for drinking purposes. The practical approach included identification of the maximum pumping rate from the wells of the spas, analysis of the response time of the system under development and drafting of a safeguard and monitoring plan. The case examined takes into account the complexity of the task in defining practical measures for groundwater management on the basis of theoretical concepts of its sustainable use. A participative approach among the different water decision-makers and adaptive management in the use of groundwater resources with different quality represent the key points to overcome conflicts between different users, with the awareness of the ineludible uncertainties of the hydrogeological model.

J	Chen, XJ				Chen, XinJian			A study of effects of reduction of submarine groundwater discharge on thermal habitats for manatee in a spring-fed estuary using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Submarine groundwater discharge; Spring-fed estuary; Laterally averaged hydrodynamic model; Chronic thermal habitats for manatee; Acute thermal habitats for manatee	SIMULATING HYDRODYNAMICS; TRANSPORT; SALINITY; SHALLOW; FLORIDA; FLOWS; RIVER	Effects of the reduction of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) on thermal habitats for manatee in the Homosassa River, a spring-fed estuary in Florida, were studied using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model. The estuary receives its hydrologic loading from numerous spring vents, mainly located at its headwaters and two upstream tributaries. The model was calibrated and verified against real-time data collected during November 2014 -August 2017 before it was used to simulate hydrodynamics, salinity transport, and thermal dynamics in the estuary from October 9, 2007 to March 12, 2018 with various SGD reductions. Effects of the SGD reduction on chronic (72-hour timescale) and acute (4-hour timescale) thermal habitats for manatee were analyzed at five critical time points (CTPs), including those of the lowest air temperature in 2010 and 2018, the lowest water temperature, the minimum thermal habitats, and the most sensitive extremely low habitats. It is found that the chronic thermal habitats for manatee decrease linearly with the increase of the SGD reduction at these CTPs. When chronic thermal habitats are extremely low, they are most sensitive to the SGD reduction. Every 1% reduction of the SGD could cause roughly a 1.31 - 1.32% reduction of > 20 degrees C water volume and a 1.28% reduction of > 20 degrees C surface area. The chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the Homosassa River can be predicted using a simple heat flux parameter (Hf), which explains 92% and 93% of the total variances of > 20 degrees C water volume and surface area, respectively using a logarithm relationship. The linearity of the relationships between the acute thermal habitats for manatee and the SGD reduction is weak. In fact, when acute thermal habitats in the estuary are extremely low, their relationships with the SGD reduction are very nonlinear, with the global minimum points varying significantly for various SGD reductions.

The results showed an increased content and concentration range of trace elements in precipitation, soil water and spring water in the vicinity of the Sostanj Thermal Power Plant. We demonstrated that the k(0)-based method of INAA as a multielement nondestructive technique is a highly suitable approach to determining some toxic trace elements in environmental studies of the water cycle.

J	Guan, JH; Pei, YC; Zhang, H; Wu, JT				Guan, Jing-Han; Pei, Yong-Chen; Zhang, Hang; Wu, Ji-Tuo			An investigation on the driving characteristics continuous measurement of reverse deformation SMA springs	MECCANICA			English	Article						Driving characteristics; Phase transformation; SMA springs; Thermal cycle; Water bath	MEMORY; BEHAVIOR; WIRES; ALLOYS; DESIGN; STRAIN	Shape memory alloy (SMA) springs have been widely applied in engineering. However, there are few studies on the driving characteristics of the reverse deformation SMA springs which stretch during heating and contract during cooling. It is necessary to develop a specialized experimental setup that can measure the driving characteristics of these special SMA springs, including temperature, deformation, and restoring force in a reciprocating continuous way. In this paper, an experimental setup with a water bath has been developed. Based on the setup, the comprehensive relationship between temperature, deformation, and restoring force of the reverse deformation SMA spring can be obtained by only one thermal cycle. The experiment results show that the maximum deformation decreases linearly with the increase of restoring force, and the deformation is negatively correlated with the maximum restoring force. Moreover, the martensite reverse transformation leads to an increase of the spring coefficient. The shear modulus increases with the increase of temperature. It is also concluded that the size of the spring affects the restoring force and deformation. Finally, the driving characteristics are modeled and analyzed theoretically, and the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results. The experimental setup and methods can be useful for designing temperature control valves and switches, without an additional heat source.

The field experiment included the control and the following soil-improving cropping systems: liming, leguminous catch crops for green manure, farm-yard manure, and liming+leguminous catch crops+farmyard manure together with spring oats (2017) and spring wheat (2018). The parameters such as bulk density, water content, and values of soil thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity have been determined. The thermal properties were measured at the current water content in situ and in water-saturated and dry soil states in the laboratory. The thermal properties in the wet year of 2017 increased in the subareas with a predominance of leguminous catch crops for green manure, farmyard manure, and liming+leguminous catch crops+farmyard manure, whereas the soil-improving cropping systems effect was not consistent after stubble tilling in the dry year of 2018. Cross-semivariograms which used the sand content as an auxiliary variable and cokriging produced a better prediction than the semivariograms and kriging. The fractal analysis indicated that the number of subareas differ-ing in thermal properties was mainly modified by water content and bulk density. The spatial spread of the soil thermal properties during the water-saturated and dry states increased in subareas with a higher bulk density.

Determination of gross alpha and beta activities in waters from Batman, Turkey	DESALINATION			English	Article						Gross alpha and beta; Water; Batman	BOTTLED DRINKING-WATER; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-RADIOACTIVITY; ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY; SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY; SURFACE WATERS; HEAVY-METALS; REGION; GREECE; SPAIN	The city of Batman, located in the southeastern part of Turkey, has lately been receiving national attention because of its oil reserves and production, and cultural, tourist attractions and rapid industrialization. There is no information about radioactivity measurement reported in water samples in the Batman province so far. For this reason, the concentrations of gross alpha and beta radioactivity in water samples collected from 16 different sampling stations in Batman have been determined. The instrumentation used to count the gross alpha and beta activities was an alpha/beta counter of the low background multiple detector type with 10 sample detectors (Berthold LB770). The obtained results showed that natural activity concentrations of alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides in drinking water, river water and well water samples are within the range recommended by WHO, while thermal spring water is not in this range. Gross alpha and beta activities of tap, well and river waters range from 10.8 mBq.l(-1) to 73.4 mBq.l(-1) and from 3 mBq.l(-1) to 347 mBq.l(-1), respectively. Concentration of thermal spring water is 3909.5 and 2097 mBq.l(-1) for gross alpha and beta, respectively. The gross beta activities are generally higher than the corresponding gross a activities. The results obtained in this study indicate that the individual effective doses are below the WHO recommended reference level of 0.1 mSv.y(-1) for all water samples, except for the thermal spring water, and shows no significant departure from the other parts of the country.

Calvin, Jr.			Classification of Thermal Patterns at Karst Springs and Cave Streams	GROUND WATER			English	Article							GROUNDWATER-FLOW; HEAT-TRANSFER; AQUIFER SYSTEM; CONDUIT FLOW; WATER; HYDROGRAPHS; CHEMOGRAPHS; TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; KENTUCKY	Thermal patterns of karst springs and cave streams provide potentially useful information concerning aquifer geometry and recharge. Temperature monitoring at 25 springs and cave streams in southeastern Minnesota has shown four distinct thermal patterns. These patterns can be divided into two types: those produced by flow paths with ineffective heat exchange, such as conduits, and those produced by flow paths with effective heat exchange, such as small fractures and pore space. Thermally ineffective patterns result when water flows through the aquifer before it can equilibrate to the rock temperature. Thermally ineffective patterns can be either event-scale, as produced by rainfall or snowmelt events, or seasonal scale, as produced by input from a perennial surface stream. Thermally effective patterns result when water equilibrates to rock temperature, and the patterns displayed depend on whether the aquifer temperature is changing over time. Shallow aquifers with seasonally varying temperatures display a phase-shifted seasonal signal, whereas deeper aquifers with constant temperatures display a stable temperature pattern. An individual aquifer may display more than one of these patterns. Since karst aquifers typically contain both thermally effective and ineffective routes, we argue that the thermal response is strongly influenced by recharge mode.

The obtained results show that U-238 activity concentrations vary between 1.5 and about 43 mBq/l. The measured activities of U-234 and Ra-226 range from 1.1 to about 82.2 mBq/l and 34-3900 mBq/l, respectively. The radioactive disequilibria in these waters are in excess of concentration of U-234 compared to that of U-238. The Ra-226/U-234 activity ratios are high and in the range of 9.0-691.0. U. Th and Ra activities are similar to those published for other non-polluted regions of the world. Radioactivity in the only cold mineral water from Ain Oktor is very low, and thus health hazards due to the consumption of this water are not expected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

HYDROGEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN SPA AREAS OF SERBIA Main Properties and Possible Improvement of Use	THERMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						spa; thermal water; space heating; energy efficiency		Geological complexity of the territory of Serbia is a world curiosity: six main geotectonic regions and tens sub-regions are delineated in a small area of 88,000 km(2). Geologic origin and regional structure of some areas has long been the subject of discussion. Notable magmatism and associated tectonic events in the Earth's crust provided for a fairly large hydrogeothermal resource potential, which is manifested in more than 250 warm (mainly mineral) springs and more than 100 hydrothermal wells. Thermal springs and wells together discharge some 5 m(3)/s. This potential is used in part for balneal therapy (waters differ in temperature and chemical composition) in the spa areas of Serbia. The amounts of thermal water unused therapeutically or the amounts of heat energy from unused geothermal water may be used in almost all spas for space heating/cooling and thus increase the efficiency of the thermal water energy utilization. This also will be cost-effective, reduce emission of noxious gases, and improve the environmental-health image of the resorts. The hydrogeothermal resources are described for 29 spas with 700 l/s total discharge capacity of water temperature between 25 degrees C and 96 degrees C, or an overall heat energy of 78.40 MWt. Feasibility of additional energy utilization of thermal water in spas is generally considered.

Hydrogels prepared with distilled water were also analysed with comparative purposes. To this end, thermo-rheological, textural or sensorial analysis of the gelled matrices were conducted. Rheological results indicated the existence of differences in the viscoelastic properties between the starchy matrices formulated with different thermal waters, with the softest gel character identified for systems where the mineral-richest thermal water (TW-III) was incorporated. The lowest gelatinization temperature required to form the gelled matrices was also found for the formulation prepared with this type of water. Textural testing confirmed the findings achieved with rheological measurements. Sensory evaluation showed a good acceptance of the proposed personal care products, those prepared with TW-III largely preferred by the volunteers? panel. Overall, the obtained outcomes indicated that selected starchy hydrogels could be attractive matrices to make natural hand gels (10%, 60 ?C) or lipsticks (20%, 60 ?C).	[Torres, M.

Soil gas flux, hydrogeochemistry and multicomponent geothermometry of thermal springs in the La Escalera geothermal prospect, Mexico	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Geothermal energy; Direct use; Water-rock interaction; Bicarbonate thermal springs	MINERAL EQUILIBRIA; VOLCANIC BELT; BORON; SYSTEM; CO2; WATERS; MICHOACAN; ENERGY; REFLECTANCE; CHLORIDE	The La Escalera geothermal system, a southern region of the Sierra Mil Cumbres, Mexico, is considered a potential prospect for geothermal resources. Geochemical exploration techniques such as thermal water chemical analysis, soil gas flux measurements, mineralogy analysis, and geochemical modeling were applied to develop a conceptual model of the geothermal area. Thermal water samples were analyzed to examine their chemical features. The thermal waters are mainly near-neutral bicarbonate type with sodium as the major cation. A high variation of gas fluxes was observed, and the correlation of CO2 diffuse degassing with fault system in the La Escalera geothermal area is related to local failure stresses. The integrated multicomponent geothermometry method was performed to rebuild deep fluid chemical composition and estimate the optimal bottom temperature. Results show a bottom temperature of 120 degrees C where concentrations of Al, Mg, CO2, and selected minerals for geothermometry modeling are critical variables for successfully constraining the mixing processes. Geochemical modeling was performed to evaluate the water-rock equilibria. The chemical characteristics of the thermal waters indicate interaction with andesitic rocks, and the chemical processes governing the formed hydrothermal mineralogy include both cation exchange and hydrolysis reactions. The methodology of this study can be helpful for other potential geothermal areas with similar conditions.

The hydrogeochemistry of hot springs can be used to interpret the formation of the hydrothermal system; and the C-14 dating can be used to evaluate the renewability of the hydrothermal system. The hot springs exposed from fault zones in western Guangdong are classified as granite fissure water and clastic rock fissure water, which are sampled and tested. The results of water chemistry analysis show that hot spring water is mainly HCO3-Na type in the beginning, while the mixing of seawater leads to the increase of Cl-. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate that these hot springs mainly come from atmospheric precipitation, and water-rock interactions produce oxygen isotope exchange reactions, where a significant "oxygen drift" phenomenon can be observed. The relationship between d(13)C and HCO(3)(-)indicates that there is a deep source of CO2 "dead carbon" in hot spring water. This systematic error is not considered in the existing C-14 dating correction models. The C-14 age of the deep source "dead carbon" correction proposed in this paper is close to the C-14 age of the reverse chemical simulation correction, the Gonfiantinie model, and the Mook model. The deep source "dead carbon" correction method can improve the systematic error. Therefore, the C-14 age corrected by the deep source "dead carbon" may be more representative in terms of the actual age of geothermal water.

Relatively high T-h values in samples from shallow depths indicate erosion of about 200 m of caldera fill since deposition of hydrothermal minerals at shallow depths in the Sulphur Springs hydrothermal system, accompanied by a descent in the water table of the liquid-dominated reservoir. For samples collected below the current water level of the well, the minimum values of homogenization temperature (T-h) fit the present thermal profile, whereas minimum T-h values of samples from above the water level are several tens of degrees higher than the present thermal profile and fit a paleo-thermal profile following the boiling point curve for pure water, as adjusted to 92 degrees C at 20 m below the present land surface. This is attributed to development of an evolving vapor zone that formed subsequent to a sudden drop in the water table of the liquid-dominated reservoir. We suggest that these events were caused by the drainage of an intracaldera lake when the southwestern wall of the caldera was breached about 0.5 Ma. This model indicates that vapor zones above major liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs can be formed due to dramatic changes in geohydrology and not just from simple boiling.

Eleven springs (3 in Haqlanya, 4 in Kubaysa and 4 in Hit) have been addressed for the purpose of water evaluation for balneology, drinking, irrigation and aquaculture (fish farming). In order to meet the objectives of this research, all springs were sampled and analyzed for the total dissolved solid, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+), major anions (SO4 (2-), Cl-, HCO3 (-) and CO3 (2-)), minor anions (PO4 (3-)and NO3 (-)) as well as the trace elements that included Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu, Br, F, Ba, B, Sr, Al, As, Cr, Hg and Se. The International Standards of World Health Organization are used for assessing the water quality. The results revealed that the springs belong to the tepid springs of 27-30 A degrees C and classified as hypothermal to the thermal springs. Lithochemistry and geochemical processes clearly affected the water chemistry. The hydrogeochemical processes are responsible for the element enrichment in water by the chemical dissolution of carbonate and gypsum and evaporation as well. The results of the study indicate the possibility of using spring water for therapeutic purposes, but not allowed for drinking and aquaculture (fish farming), except those free of H2S gas. On the other hand, it can be used for irrigation with risk. However, soil type as well as proper selection of plants should be taken into consideration.

Whether the genesis of all geothermal water in the north section of the Sanjiang Orogenic belt is consistent is still an unanswered question. In order to fill the research gap of the high temperature geothermal system in this region, in this study, we classified the geothermal springs into three geothermal fields (Jinsha, Lancang, and Nujiang geothermal fields) and attempted to find clues by comparing the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of geothermal fluids in the three geothermal fields. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 composition of geothermal springs suggest that all thermal springs are replenished by the meteoric water. Low content of trace elements and low degree of oxygen isotope shift indicate that the partial melting of the crust at a depth of about 20 km mainly provide heat for all thermal springs in the geothermal fields through conduction. But due to the difference of tectonic conditions, there are two formation patterns of geothermal waters in the study area, one was controlled by regional faults, the other was controlled by the folded complex. The geothermal waters controlled by regional faults were heated after deep circulation, and the reservoir temperatures calculated by the Silica-enthalpy mixing model are 175-200 degrees C and 200-225 degrees C, respectively. But the geothermal waters controlled by the folded complex were heated after shallow circulation, and the reservoir temperature is only 100-125 degrees C. Upon rising to the surface, the geothermal waters mixed with cold groundwater to different degrees. The dissolution of Na/K-silicates and carbonate rocks controlled the formation of Na-HCO3 and Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 type water, respectively. But dissolution of halite and gypsum (or anhydrite) in some areas can lead to further diversity of hydrochemical species, resulting in the formation of Na-Cl, Na-HCO3 center dot Cl, Ca center dot MgSO4 and Na-HCO3 center dot SO4 type waters.

Low-temperature outflow water in spring and summer will have a negative impact on the downstream ecological environment. Therefore, it is necessary to take selective withdrawal measures to regulate low-temperature outflow water. The temperature-control curtain project has the advantages of low cost, convenient construction and wide application. Based on the topographic data, a laboratory test model for regulating outflow temperature by a temperature-control curtain is established. A high-power electric heating system is adopted to form a nonlinear thermal stratification. The accuracy of the test data is verified by the prototype observed water temperature. The main parameters affecting the outflow temperature are investigated, including thermal stratification, flow height above the temperature-control curtain, water level, and discharge flow. The results show the following: firstly, the outflow temperature mainly depends on the thermal stratification, decreases with the increase of water level, and increases with the increase of discharge flow; secondly, the effect of a temperature-control curtain on improving the outflow temperature is directly related to the thermal stratification in different months, and the improvement effect is better in spring and summer; finally, the improvement effect increases with the decrease of flow height above the temperature-control curtain, increases with the increase of water level, and decreases with the increase of discharge flow.

However, temperature-mediated risks to salmon are often complex and addressing them requires species-and population specific data collected over large spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we combined radiotelemetry with archival depth and temperature sensors to collect continuous thermal exposure histories of 21 adult spring-and summer-run Chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha) as they migrated hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Columbia River basin. Salmon thermal histories in impounded reaches of the Columbia and Snake rivers were characterized by low daily temperature variation but frequent and extensive vertical movements. Dives were associated with slightly cooler salmon body temperatures (similar to 0.01 to 0.02 C/m), but there was no evidence for use of cool-water thermal refuges deep in reservoirs or at tributary confluences along the migration route. In tributaries, salmon were constrained to relatively shallow water, and they experienced similar to 2-5 degrees C diel temperature fluctuations. Differences in migration timing and among route-specific thermal regimes resulted in substantial among-individual variation in migration temperature exposure. Bioenergetics models using the collected thermal histories and swim speeds ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 body-lengths/s predicted median energetic costs of similar to 24-40% (spring-run) and 37-60% (summer-run) of initial reserves. Median declines in total mass were similar to 16-24% for spring-run salmon and similar to 19-29% for summer-run salmon. A simulated + 2 degrees C increase in water temperatures resulted in 4.0% (spring-run) and 6.3% (summer-run) more energy used per fish, on average. The biotelemetry data provided remarkable spatial and temporal resolution on thermal exposure. Nonetheless, substantial information gaps remain for the development of robust bioenergetics and climate effects models for adult Chinook salmon.

Magadi is a perennial lake but with an extensive trona crust. Thermal springs occur at many points around the lake. The northern Suguta Valley has surface water only intermittently, apart from the very small Lake Logipi. Thermal springs tend to discharge onto sediment fans. Chemical and stable isotopic data from the springs of each basin have revealed some fundamental differences. Chemically these can be summarised as a greater loss of carbonate in the Suguta and a major loss of sulphate at Magadi, while isotopically the waters of the Suguta are more evaporated than those of Magadi. The hydrogeological habitat of the Suguta promotes the recirculation of waters, leading both to the removal of carbonate in surface crusts and to a well-oxygenated system in which sulphate can flourish. The latter does not occur at Magadi, leading to large amounts of sulphate reduction.

Each earthquake caused significant hydrochemical and isotopic changes in the three thermal springs. Hydrochemical ions (such as Ca2+ and HCO3-) decreased sharply following the Wenchuan earthquake and recovered after the Lushan and Kangding earthquakes. Although delta D and delta O-18 data from before the Wenchuan earthquake are lacking, we find that SD and delta O-18 after the Lushan and Kangding earthquakes shifted toward the local meteoric water line (LMWL). Both the hydrochemical and isotope data indicate changes in the mixture of different waters, CO2 degassing and geothermal reservoir temperatures. Combining this information with the noble gas analysis, we interpret that new flow paths were created after the Wenchuan earthquake and were reclogged following the Lushan and Kangding earthquakes. More groundwater with low HCO3- and Ca2+ from the granite aquifer entered the hydrothermal system, and more CO2 escaped from the water following the Wenchuan earthquake, while less water from the granite aquifer entered the system following the Lushan and Kangding earthquakes. This study indicates that permeability can either increase or decrease in the near field following different earthquakes. Such changes should be considered significant factors in the management of groundwater supply and earthquake precursor monitoring in seismically active areas.

In SPring-8, for example, cryogenic cooling is used for silicon monochromator crystal with an indium insertion metal at the interface between a copper block and a silicon crystal. To reduce the strain on the silicon crystal with a low contact pressure and a high thermal conductivity, we require a silicon-indium-copper system and an alternative insertion material such as a graphite foil. To measure the thermal contact conductance in a quick measurement cycle under various thermal-contact conditions, we improve the thermal-contact-conductance measurement system in terms of the setup facilitation, precise temperature measurement, and thermal insulation around a sample.

However, many processes are involved in their genesis and often only one or two processes are investigated at the same time. Here, we propose to use an innovative combination of geochemical, isotopic (S-34, C-14, O-18, H-2) and geothermometry tools to identify, for the first time in a multi-composite geological context, all processes at the origin of diversified thermo-mineral waters. 19 springs covering a wide range of temperature and chemical composition emerging on a restricted area of Corsica Island (France) were selected. Geochemical results highlight five geochemical provinces, suggesting a common origin for some of them. Geothermometry tools show the unexpected involvement of a common deep groundwater reservoir within this non-active zone. Water stable isotopes highlight a contrasted altitude in recharge areas supplying lowland springs. This suggests that different flow patterns have to be involved to explain the wide geochemical diversity observed and to allow the design of a very first conceptual groundwater-flow model. This paper demonstrates the efficiency of the combination of the selected tools as tracers of water-rock interaction, independently of flow depth, intrinsic water properties, geological conditions and interaction time disparities.

It has a temperature of 45 degrees C, which is rich in HCO3,- and its main trace elements are B, Li and Fe, which confers healing effects. Concerns about the sustainability of this important spa have motivated this study to understand the thermal system, possible hydraulic and hydrochemical changes over time and its implications. Stable water isotope data indicate that the thermal water sources originate from local precipitation at Sierra de las Cruces with a recharge elevation of approximately 2770 m above sea level. The recharged water percolates through volcanic and carbonate rock formations and ascends via fault structure conduits, where it eventually is extracted 25 km downstream in Penon de los Banos. During the gravity-driven deep circulation of up to 4.9 km, the groundwater is heated up to 136-160 degrees C. A comparison of past and current water levels and water chemical analyses indicates a water table drop and few variations in the chemical composition, confirming the presence of anthropic impact on water quality. Due to the heavy groundwater extractions in Mexico City, the spring water flow has ceased, and water must be pumped now from a 203-m deep well. In addition, the concentration of bicarbonate, sodium and chloride has been reduced by half since the onset of groundwater development. The therapeutic effects of this thermal mineral water are at risk due to the alteration of the chemical signature. However, new and different therapeutical uses may prevent a future deterioration or closure of this historically important thermal spa. It is crucial to establish a monitoring program of the thermal mineral water and reducing or minimizing nearby urban extractions which tap the regional flow component to preserve the properties of the thermal water.

In general, the studied waters are similar to other geothermal systems in the Pyrenees, belonging to the group of granite-related alkaline thermal waters (high pH, low total dissolved solids, very low magnesium concentration, and sodium as the dominant cation). According to the alkaline pH of these waters, they have a very low CO2 partial pressure, bicarbonate is the dominant anion and silica is partially ionized as H3SiO4-. The unusually active acid-base pairs (HCO3-/CO32- and, mainly, H4SiO4/H3SiO4-,) act as homogeneous pH buffers and contribute to the total alkalinity in these alkaline waters. On the basis of the study of the conservative elements, a mixing process between a hot and a cold end-member has been identified. Additionally, in order to determinate the water temperature at the reservoir, several geothermometric techniques have been applied, including both geothermometrical modeling and classical geothermometrical calculations. The geothermometrical modeling seems to indicate that thermal waters re-equilibrate with respect to calcite and kaolinite during their ascent to the surface. Modeling results suggest that these thermal waters would be in equilibrium with respect to albite, K-feldspar, quartz, calcite, kaolinite and zoisite at a similar temperature of 90 +/- 20 degrees C in the reservoir, which is in good agreement with the results obtained by applying the classical geothermometers.

Historical issues of hydrotherapy in thermal-mineral springs of the Hellenic world	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Asclepieia; Balneotherapy; Classical and Hellenistic periods; Medicine; Water	WATER; AQUEDUCTS; GREECE; ORIGIN	Many springs have been recorded in Greece; some of them are characterized as thermo-mineral springs and are associated with their position between Eurasia and Africa, the volcanic activity, and the presence of tectonic faults. The therapeutic use of water (hydrotherapy) has been recorded in ancient Greece since at least 1000 BC. Asclepius was the god of medicine in ancient Greek religion and priests operated his worship centers (Asclepieia) offering medical services in areas with proper climatic conditions. In historical times, Hippocrates from the Aegean island of Kos (460-375 BC) is considered the father of scientific medicine as well as hydrotherapy. During the Hellenistic period, the significance of water in health was widely recognized. In the Roman era, many doctors evolved hydrotherapy treatment and the use of hot baths continued in the early Byzantine period until the sixth century AD. Finally, during the Ottoman period, the kind of respiratory bath, named Hamam, was the dominant form in public baths. Their temperature ranges between 20.5 and 83 & DEG;C, and the dominant hydrochemical type is Na-Cl. This review describes the history of hydrotherapy in Greece through the centuries, the physicochemical characteristics of thermal springs, as well as contemporary and future trends and challenges are presented.

Thermal springs, fumaroles and gas vents of continental Yemen: Their relation with active tectonics, regional hydrology and the country's geothermal potential	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							ORIGIN; OLIGOCENE; VOLCANISM; HELIUM; WATERS; VALLEY; PART; CO2	Most thermal springs of continental Yemen (about 65 emergences at 48 sampling sites) and a couple of fumaroles and boiling water pools have been sampled and analyzed for chemical and isotopic composition in the liquid phase and the associated free-gas phase. Whatever the emergence, all the water discharges have an isotopic signature of meteoric origin. Springs seeping out from high altitudes in the central volcanic plateau show a prevalent Na-HCO3-composition, clearly affected by an anomalous flux of deep CO2 deriving from active hydrothermal systems located in the Jurassic Amran Group limestone sequence and/or the Cretaceous Tawilah Group, likely underlying the 2000-3000 m thick volcanic suite. At lower elevations, CO2 also affects the composition of some springs emerging at the borders of the central volcanic plateau. Although mixing to a limited extent with organic CO2 infiltrating together with the meteoric recharge waters cannot be ruled out, all the CO2-rich gas samples have a delta C-13-CO2 signature that falls in the range of mantle CO2 (-3 < delta C-13 < -7% V-PDB). The relatively high He-3/He-4 (1 < R/R-a < 3.2) ratios measured in all the CO2-rich springs and also some mixed N-2-CO2 gas vents in the far east Hadramaut region support the presence of mantle magmas and related hydrothermal systems residing at the crust level in several areas of Yemen. This well agrees with the presence of Quaternary basaltic magmatic activity along the Gulf of Aden, as well as inside the central Yemen volcanic plateau. Presently, the thermal springs of Yemen are prevalently used for spas and/or bathing. Nevertheless, liquid- and gas-geothermometry and geological considerations suggest that there are at least three areas (Al Lisi, Al Makhaya and Damt) inside the Yemen volcanic plateau (around Dhamar) that may be promising prospects for the future development of geothermal energy in Yemen. Alternatively, they could be used as a source of energy for small-to-medium scale agriculture and/or industrial purposes. Moreover, most of the thermal water discharges have the chemical characteristics of potable waters and, in an and country like Yemen, they have to be considered as long-term water supply resources if the country should face water shortages.

Microorganisms of Two Thermal Pools on Kunashir Island, Russia	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						metagenome; hot spring; microbial community; genome; Kuril Islands	HOT-SPRINGS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; ARCHAEAL; GENOMES; ALGORITHM; KAMCHATKA	Simple Summary The Kuril Islands are a part of the Circum-Pacific Belt of volcanoes and have many hot springs. Nonetheless, due to the border regime, these islands are difficult to access, and microbial communities of the geothermal springs of these islands have hardly been studied microbiologically and have not been studied metagenomically at all. Here we conducted the first metagenomic study on two thermophilic microbial communities of Kunashir Island. Faust Lake is hot (48 degrees C) and highly acidic (pH 2.0), whereas the Tretyakovsky Thermal Spring is also hot (52 degrees C) but weakly acidic (pH 6.0). We demonstrated that water pH affects the composition of the microbial communities. The Kuril Archipelago is a part of the Circum-Pacific Belt (Ring of Fire). These islands have numerous thermal springs. There are very few studies on these microbial communities, and none of them have been conducted by modern molecular biological methods. Here we performed the first metagenomic study on two thermophilic microbial communities of Kunashir Island. Faust Lake is hot (48 degrees C) and highly acidic (pH 2.0). We constructed 28 metagenome-assembled genomes as well as 17 16S ribosomal RNA sequences. We found that bottom sediments of Faust Lake are dominated by a single species of red algae belonging to the Cyanidiaceae family. Archaeans in Faust Lake are more diverse than bacteria but less abundant. The Tretyakovsky Thermal Spring is also hot (52 degrees C) but only weakly acidic (pH 6.0). It has much higher microbial diversity (233 metagenome-assembled genomes; 93 16S ribosomal RNAs) and is dominated by bacteria, with only several archaeans and one fungus. Despite their geographic proximity, these two thermal springs were found to not share any species. A comparison of these two lakes with other thermal springs of the Circum-Pacific Belt revealed that only a few members of the communities are shared among different locations.

The first type includes HCO3-Cl-Na-Mg water with extremely low mineralization (44-87 mg/dm(3)) and pH variations from weakly acidic to weakly alkaline values (5.71-7.84). The second type includes HCO3-Na water with mineralization up to 256-659 mg/dm(3) and pH 8.03 to 8.51. The studied types differ significantly in temperature: 24.3-34.5 degrees C in the first type and 62.1-97.1 degrees C in the second type. The analysis of the distribution of oxygen (O-18) and hydrogen (D) isotopes carried out for the first time confirms different genetic nature of these hydrogeochemical water types. The first type has an atmospheric genesis (O-18 = -7.3...-6.2 parts per thousand and D = -51.4...-39.3 parts per thousand), while the second type restricted to the Kien Giang-Bang intersection zone has a deeper source (O-18 = -1.6...-1.3 parts per thousand and D= -22.2...-21.4 parts per thousand). The tritium (H-3) data also point to different circulation times of these waters. The formation time of the HCO3-Cl-Na-Mg waters does not exceed 50 years (H-3 = 4.3-11.1 ??), while that of HCO3-Na water may reach more than 1000 years (H-3 = 0.5 TE).	[Novikov, D.

The gases are dominated by H2O, CO2, S (as SO2 and H2S) and HCl. The relative proportions of these gases classify them as 'magmatic'. Thermodynamic equilibrium temperatures of the gases range from 260 to > 600 degrees C. The relative abundance of inert gases, N-2, Ar and He, can be used as 'tracers' to identify the source of the fumarole discharges. At Galeras the majority of the samples have a composition characteristic of gases originating from are-related magmas, with relatively high N-2 contents and minor He and Ar. During 1993, the year of frequent eruptions, the gas composition changed to basaltic or 'mantle-derived' gases, with significantly higher He contents. This is interpreted to be the result of injection of volatiles from a basaltic magma body at depth prior to and during the increased eruptive activity of 1993. The delta(13)C values for CO2 in fumarole discharges are typical of andesitic volcanoes and may indicate addition of MORE-derived CO2. The delta(15)N values for N-2 may indicate significant, contribution of N-2 from marine sediments and only minor contribution of MORE-derived N-2. The delta D and delta(18)O values of the discharging steam lie on a mixing trend between the isotopic composition of 'arc-related' magmatic water and O-18-shifted meteoric water. The most magmatic discharges have SD values of -30 to -35 parts per thousand; while the most meteoric discharges have values of -70 to -75 parts per thousand, similar to Galeras thermal spring waters. Galeras thermal water discharges consist of acid sulfate and bicarbonate waters. S/Cl ratios in the acid sulfate waters are similar to fumarole ratios, suggesting direct absorption of magmatic gases into shallow ground waters. This is supported by the essentially meteoric delta D and delta(18)O values of the discharges and by elevated He-3/He-4 ratios of thermal spring waters. The absorption of acid S- and Cl-rich gases yield acid waters which are capable of dissolving rocks. The thermal waters, however, are far from equilibrium with Galeras lavas and pyroclastic rocks, providing evidence of the immaturity of the Galeras hydrothermal. system. The SO4 and CI content, as well as the O and H isotopic composition of Galeras thermal springs vary with the activity of the volcano.

In inflammatory skin disease, the pathogenesis is due to an immune reaction in the keratinocytes, immune cells and soluble mediators. Balneotherapy is widely used for the treatment of inflammatory skin disease, but the mechanisms are only partly understood by immune regulation. Balneotherapy in dermatologic disease can affect the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor from keratinocytes, and possibly affect the T cell differentiation. Objective: In this study, we evaluated the effect of spa spring water from Yong-gung oncheon on the cells, and investigated the skin immune reaction. Methods: We investigated the immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory effect of thermal spring water on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the HaCaT cells under Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, as well as the effect on the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells under spring water. Results: The treatment of spa spring water from Yong-gung oncheon decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR stimulation to the HaCaT cells and antigen presenting cells. In addition, spa spring water attenuated the differentiation process of subsets of CD4(+) T cells, i.e., Thl, Th2 and Th17 cells. All these immune parameters can be used to evaluate the efficacy of spa spring water in Korea, in terms of the immune modulatory effect. Conclusion: Spa spring water treatment suppressed the inflammatory cytokines production and also modulated the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, but not the T-regs cells.

Geochemical signatures of the groundwaters from Ourense thermal springs, Galicia, Spain	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Geothermal systems; Chemical equilibrium; Faults; Ourense; Thermal springs	FLUID-FLOW; MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN; HEAT-TRANSFER; FAULT ZONES; HOT-SPRINGS; CIRCULATION; EQUILIBRIA; SYSTEMS	Different hot springs and boreholes in the city of Ourense, Galicia, Spain, have been studied to determine the mineral equilibrium conditions of the discharged groundwaters and the reservoir temperatures predicted by the equilibrium conditions. Ourense is located in the Mino River's valley. The area is characterized by two fault systems, which determine groundwater circulation. A NW trending fault system is the permeable system that transfers groundwaters and heat to springs in the Mino River valley as it is evident from the location of the springs in the region. Groundwaters traveling and discharging from granitic and schistose rocks are mainly bicarbonate waters. In comparison, groundwaters traveling and discharging from granodiorite rocks can be bicarbonate, sulfate or chloride waters. Different equilibrium activity diagrams for the dominant cations in groundwater (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) have been constructed to correlate water equilibrium conditions with the mineral assemblage, K-feldspar, clinochlore, muscovite, quartz, and calcite. Granites and schists are the rocks within which groundwater circulation approaches mineral equilibrium with equilibrium temperatures around 140-160 degrees C. Groundwaters circulating throughout granodiorite seem a little bit high in Mg2+ to reach equilibrium conditions. Mino River's tectonic valley presents strong morphological contrasts in terms of faulting and rock types to the north of the river that allow increased longitude and depth of groundwater circulation. These conditions allow close achievement of water-mineral equilibrium conditions. More research is needed to know the extension of this energy resource and optimize its use.	[Lopez, D.

They can be regarded as worth developing because of their human health implications and, if thermal tourism is promoted, their importance to the local economy. Because the effects of thermal waters on human health are not yet completely known and understood, it would be of interest to identify organic compounds responsible for their biological activity. This manuscript reports results from analysis of thermal waters in Calabria. Molecular clusters of sulfur atoms were detected in the waters and polysulfide ions were identified after conversion to the corresponding dimethyl derivatives. The occurrence of C-16 and C-18 unsaturated fatty acids can probably be attributed to the algae present in the water.

The Xiannvshan hot spring in the sandstone aquiclude near the Tongluoxia anticline in northeast Sichuan Basin of China is an up-flow spring discharging thermal groundwater from the underlying carbonate aquifer of the basin-anticline controlled type. This rarely-encountered up-flow spring neither issues directly from an aquifer, nor is controlled by a fault. The spring water is a very hard (hardness of 1050.0691835.697 mg/L) and brackish hot spring water (TDS of 1650-2802 mg/L) of SO4-Ca type and low temperature (34-38 degrees C) issuing from a neutral and reduction subsurface environment, and is characterized by high ratios of gamma Na/gamma Cl (average 1.354) and low gamma Ca/gamma SO4 (average 0.779), and high concentrations of Sr (7.62-17.183 mg/ L) and F (1.87-8.15 mg/L). The Sigma MREE of the hot water samples are greater than Sigma LREE, and positive Eu and negative Ce anomalies exist. The dissolved constituents in the hot water are derived from the dissolution of calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, gypsum, polyhalite, halite, albite and K-feldspar and small amount of sylvite, epsomite, thenardite, langbeinite, celestite, barite, strontianite, magnesite, and fluorite in the carbonate aquifer, and the dissolution of sulphates prevails in the groundwater system. Hydrochemical similarity is found among the water samples from the two springs' vents and the flowing borehole near the vents. Faster groundwater circulation caused by the flowing hot water borehole encourages the dissolution of minerals in the carbonate aquifer and slightly increases the TDS and temperature of the hot water from the flowing borehole.

J	Pentecost, A				Pentecost, A			The origin and development of the travertines and associated thermal waters at Matlock Bath, Derbyshire	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							YORKSHIRE; CRUSTS; WORLD; MODEL	An investigation has been made of the hydrochemistry of the five thermal springs at Matlock Bath and the geochemistry of the associated travertines. The thermal waters are shown to have a common source and originate from precipitation which has equilibrated with a soil atmosphere which has descended through Carboniferous Limestone at a depth probably no greater than 0.5 km. The springs issue below a basalt lava at Matlock Bath at 20 degrees C. Two springs deposit travertine (calcareous tufa) which covers an area of about 6 ha. The travertines consist of low magnesian calcite but with high levels of Sr, Pb and Zn. Their delta(13)C and delta(18)O values indicate deposition at or close to isotopic equilibrium with the springwater and confirm a soil-origin of the CO2 in the percolation water. The travertines form around the moss Cratoneuron commutatum which provides an open framework and is ultimately cemented with microspar to form a tough low-porosity deposit. Inactive travertines at the New Bath contain molluscan and pollen assemblages suggesting an open nitrophile woodland environment probably of Atlantic age or later.

Seven samples were collected from thermal springs of near-neutral pH (6.2 to 7.56) with discharge temperatures between 42.9 and 66.1 degrees C. Hydrogeochemical analyses of the thermal waters reveal four types (Na+-Ca2+-Cl-, Na+-Ca2+-Cl--HCO3-, Na+-Ca2+-Cl--SO42-, and Na+-HCO3--Cl-) and show high total dissolved solids up to 4002 mg/L. Stable isotopic results (delta O-18 and delta D) indicate that the thermal waters are of meteoric origin deeply infiltrated and heated by advective heat anomalies and raised up to the surface through deep-seated faults acting as hydrothermal conduits. The estimated reservoir temperatures using silica geothermometers and fluid-mineral equilibria overlap between 66 and 125 degrees C, while Na/K and K/Mg geothermometers give much higher and lower results, respectively, and are mainly influenced by mixing with cooler Mg groundwaters as indicated by the Na-K-Mg plot in the immature water field and in silica and chloride mixing models. Thermal waters deeply circulated and heated at a depth of 2 km were supplied by the higher geothermal gradients, which can reach 42.8 degrees C km(-1) due to the complex geological setting.

Eleven samples were collected during the period between November 2013 and April 2015. To identify the origin of the thermal groundwater and for the evaluation of the reservoir temperature in the geothermal systems, the following data were used: concentrations of major chemical constituents, stable isotope ratios (delta D and delta O-18), saturation indices and chemical geothermometer temperatures. The physicochemical parameters (temperature, pH, and electric conductivity) were measured in-situ; the temperature of the thermal water samples varied from 38 to 96 degrees C, the pH value of these springs is slightly acid to neutral, with high electrical conductivities up to 4500 mu S/Cm. Piper diagrams highlighted two major hydrochemical facies namely sodium chloride (Na-Cl) and sodium sulfate (Na-SO4). The mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations found in the deep origin reservoir and chemical changes in the fluids were highly influenced by water-rock interaction. The thermal waters from the study area are depleted in O-18 and D and plot on the global meteoric water line (GMWL), their deep-circulating meteoric origin shows that most thermal waters plot on or near the meteoric water line, with some exceptions due to Mediterranean precipitation, probable water-rock isotope exchange or mixing takes place between the ascending geothermal water and shallow colder groundwater. The subsurface reservoir temperatures were calculated using different solute geothermometers and computation of saturation indices for different solid phases. The highest estimated reservoir temperatures are indicated by the cation composition geothermometer (CCG) and the Na-K-Ca geothermometer, while slightly lower estimates are obtained using silica geothermometers, with local geothermal gradients ranging from 25 to 45 degrees C/kin.

Despite several prospection campaigns over the past decades, this potential has never been confirmed because many aspects of fluid supply and circulation remain unclear. To track the origin and fate of hydrothermal fluids, we analyzed the geochemistry of thermal springs (water and gas), by combining conventional tracers (major-trace elements and O, H, C, Sr, Li isotopes) with Cl isotopes, a geochemical tool under development. Added to literature data, our new results allow us to compare the composition of thermal springs with cold waters, rocks, gas, and fumarolic deposits from La Reunion and elsewhere, and to untwine the complex history of fluid mixing that constitutes the geothermal system of Piton des Neiges. delta O-18(H2O) and delta D-H2O values of springs (-8.67 to -4.9 and -56.3 to -23.5 parts per thousand VSMOW, respectively) are positioned close to the local meteoric water line, showing that thermal waters are of meteoric origin. However, their depletion in heavy isotopes relative to cold waters suggests a recharge strongly influenced by cyclones, with a possible contribution from high altitude (>= 2000m) rainfalls. Their absence of O-18 enrichment relative to the local meteoric water line indicates that the isotopic exchange between rocks and water is very limited, and therefore suggests that their deep temperatures are relatively low and/or the water/rock ratios are high. delta C-13 values in thermal waters (-8.0 to +3.2 parts per thousand PDB) and gases (-6.7 to -5.3 parts per thousand PDB) confirm that carbon is essentially of magmatic origin, which we interpret as supplied by regional degassing of La Reunion hotspot. Major-trace elements and Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.704142 to 0.704336), delta Li-7 (+2 parts per thousand and +34.8 parts per thousand LSVEC), and delta Cl-37(-0.35 parts per thousand and +0.40 parts per thousand SMOC) compositions show that three additional processes contribute to the mineralization of thermal waters: 1) interaction with basalt at temperatures >= 50 degrees C, 2) very limited seawater contamination (< 3 mol parts per thousand), and/or 3) leaching of trachyte or scrubbing of fumarolic gas or condensates emitted by a shallow trachytic magma in the volcanic edifice. The geothermal system of Piton des Neiges is thus the result of meteoric water interaction with a trachytic heat source (as a solidified intrusion or a magma pocket), unrelated to the CO2 flux. We also emphasize that thermal waters at Piton des Neiges are exceptionally isolated from seawater compared to other geothermal systems in ocean island volcanoes worldwide, which implies a heat source located above the seawater/freshwater interface. These inferences are of critical importance for the future geothermal exploration on the island, as they suggest that the geothermal resource is within reach of relatively shallow drilling depths (<= 1000 m).

Understanding the 3D Structure of a Thermal Water Fissured Granite Aquifer by Use of Geophysical Studies	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Geophysics; hydrogeology; thermal water; granites		The thermal hot springs of Caldas de Mon double dagger o, located in Northern Portugal, are supplied by a thermal water aquifer that must be preserved from pollution and anthropic effects. Enhancement of knowledge about the aquifer is therefore needed, so sustainable management and water quality preservation can be conducted, namely by replacing the springs by boreholes, which are less vulnerable to pollution. Several investigations have been conducted with this purpose, to review the available geological and hydrogeological information from the area. For this reason, several geophysical surveys were reprocessed and others were acquired and planned, so that a 3D conceptual groundwater flow model of could be drawn. Three seismic reflection profiles were acquired with the objective of locating deep faults capable of transporting groundwater to the surface and to complement information about shallow features available before the seismic survey. This information included interpretation of a dipole-dipole survey conducted in 2001, that reached an investigation depth of approximately 40 m, and two shallow boreholes drilled, after a deeper geoelectrical survey performed in the 1980s, to replace the springs. Besides the seismic reflection profiles, seven vertical electrical soundings were also acquired and refraction interpretation of the first reflection data to arrive was also undertaken to complement the information. This paper reports integrated interpretation of the geophysical and geological data to obtain a 3D conceptual model to achieve the above mentioned objectives. After interpretation and lateral correlation of the structures found in the geophysical profiles, the deep 3D conceptual model integrating the geological, hydrogeological, and geophysical information was constructed. This model was the basis for planning the location of an exploratory borehole that was drilled afterwards. From two initial locations appearing as the strongest candidates for a successful thermal water production well, one was chosen to drill a third borehole to supply the spa facilities. The third borehole results were very positive-250 m deep, temperature approximately 50A degrees C, and water flow 12.5 l/s. This example shows the utility of using geophysical methods to increase knowledge about groundwater circulation and detect favourable areas for thermal water borehole drilling to replace the hot springs with the objective of protecting the aquifer from pollution.

The thermal anomalies along the upflow zones have not been quantified, yet they are key to estimating the geothermal exploitation potential of such systems. Here we quantify the three-dimensional heat anomaly below the orogenic geothermal system at Grimsel Pass, Swiss Alps, where warm springs emanate from an exhumed, fossil hydrothermal zone. We use discharge rates and temperatures of the springs, temperature measurements along a shallow tunnel, and the formation temperature and depth of the fossil system to constrain coupled thermal-hydraulic numerical simulations of the upflow zone. The simulations reveal that upflow rates act as a first-order control on the temperature distribution and that the site is underlain by an ellipsoidal thermal plume enclosing 10(2)-10(3) PJ of anomalous heat per km depth. When the fossil system was active (3.3 Ma), the thermal plume was double its present size, corresponding to a theoretical petrothermal power output of 30-220 MW, with the 120 degrees C threshold for geothermal electricity production situated at less than 2-km depth. We conclude that mountainous orogenic belts without igneous activity and even with only low background geothermal gradients typical of waning orogens are surprisingly promising plays for petrothermal power production. Our study implies exploration should focus on major valley floors because there the hydraulic head gradients and thus upflow rates and heat anomalies reach maximum values.

Long-term variability of sea surface temperature in the coastal zone of northeastern part of the black sea in spring and autumn	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY			English	Article								Within the frameworks of the presented model, the beginning of the spring and autumn hydrological seasons depends on the temperature regime of air flows in the region under investigation. As compared with the standard procedure of season determination, this model is more flexible in taking account of the probabilistic nature of the time of the beginning of hydrological seasons and variations of their duration. It ensures a higher reliability of estimates of thermal surface water properties and analysis of their evolution within the seasons and annual cycles. A considerable irregularity in the time of the beginning of spring and autumn seasons and a possibility of significant fluctuations of their duration changes the estimation of thermal surface water conditions so considerably that the initial (calendar) model can be no longer considered as the source of reliable information.

The extent and the depths reached were the greatest in the history of the geological investigation of the discharge area of the thermal system. The results of the drilling program enabled a detailed study of the rocks, groundwater and spring sedimentation in the area as well as the preparation of new proposals for changes in the spring-protection zones. The spring sedimentation consists of world-renowned hot spring travertine, with a wide range of morphological varieties of different origins and of different ages. The oldest U-series age data (230 +/- 14 ka BP) have been obtained for travertine relicts located 22 m above the present-day bottom of the narrow valley of the Tepla River. Five other travertine deposits, partly overlapping in space and time were identified on the bottom and slopes of the valley. They were formed by gradual growth, by river erosion and since the fourteenth century by human activities.

System dynamics modelling of spring behaviour in the Orakeikorako geothermal field, New Zealand	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						geothermal spring; modelling; system dynamics; Orakeikorako; New Zealand	RADIATION; CLEAR; SKIES	System dynamics software STELLA is used to obtain mass and thermal balances of a spring in the Orakeikorako geothermal field, New Zealand, based on field measurements of water level, barometric pressure, rainfall and spring temperature. The model identifies the interactions of the principal influences on spring behaviour of rainfall, groundwater, geothermal steam and barometric pressure. The geothermal steam inflow estimated from the model, of about 0.022 kg/s, confirms the existence of a weak hydraulic connection with a deeper geothermal reservoir. (C) 2006 CNR.

The objectives of this study were to analyze population trends and assess other measured parameters, such as water temperature, specific conductance, and groundwater decline, for changes that may influence population trends. We used simple linear regression to determine significant relation ships between measured parameters. Total numbers of hot springs surveyed in the 4-km reach are declining at a rate of similar to 5 hot springs per year, and numbers of hot springs containing P. bruneauensis it the same reach are declining at a rate of 3.75 per year. We found that the decline of hot springs with and without P. bruneauensis was significantly related to the decline of the thermal aquifer which underlies this area.

Hydrogeochemical and isotopic study of thermal and mineralized waters from the Nevsehir (Kozakli) area, Central Turkey	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Turkey geothermal province; Kozakli; Anatolian geothermal provinces; travertine; hydrogeochemistty	WESTERN ANATOLIA; GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; BORATE DEPOSITS	In the Kozakli geothermal province, thermal waters are manifested along a valley 1.5 km long and 200 m in width. Thermal waters utilised by the resort and some other hotels are mostly discharged from bore wells. The issuing temperatures of the thermal waters vary from 40-50 degrees C in thermal springs and 45-96 degrees C in bores and open wells. The geochemical and isotopic signatures of the thermal water suggest mixing of thermal waters with formation waters and cold near-surface groundwaters before emerging to the surface, and hence geochemical indicators fail to indicate the near true reservoir temperatures. However, the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic signatures strongly suggest a high temperature reservoir (>220 degrees C) in the crystalline basement rocks. Long circulation of meteoric waters within the basement rocks is indicated by low tritium values in the thermal waters. Major involvement of Miocene Marls in modifying the chemical signatures of the thermal waters is inferred from the trace element concentrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although short- or long-term intake of spa water is effective in increasing gastric mucosal blood flow, and spa water therapy is useful for treating chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer, the underlying mechanisms for and precise effects of radon protection against mucosal injury are unclear. In the present study, we examined the protective effects of hot spring water drinking and radon inhalation on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in mice. Mice inhaled radon at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) for 24 h or were provided with hot spring water for 2 weeks. The activity density of Rn-222 ranged from 663 Bq/l (start point of supplying) to 100 Bq/l (end point of supplying). Mice were then orally administered ethanol at three concentrations. The ulcer index (UI), an indicator of mucosal injury, increased in response to the administration of ethanol; however, treatment with either radon inhalation or hot spring water inhibited the elevation in the UI due to ethanol. Although no significant differences in antioxidative enzymes were observed between the radon-treated groups and the non-treated control groups, lipid peroxide levels were significantly lower in the stomachs of mice pre-treated with radon or hot spring water. These results suggest that hot spring water drinking and radon inhalation inhibit ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury.

The thermal circulation and fluid outflows were examined in the area around Bormio (Central Italian Alps), where ten geothermal springs discharge from dolomite bodies located close to the regional ZebrA(1) thrust. Water is heated in deep circulation systems and upwells vigorously at a temperature of about 40 A degrees C. Heat and fluid transport is explored by steady and transient three-dimensional finite-element simulations taking into account the effect of the last glaciation, which in the study area was recognized to end around 11,000-12,000 years ago. The full regional model (ca. 700 km(2)) is discretized with a highly refined triangular finite-element planar grid. Numerical simulations suggest a reactivation of the system following the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Results correctly simulate the observed discharge rate of ca. 2,400 L/min and the spring temperatures after ca. 13,000 years from deglaciation, and show a complete cooling of the aquifer within a period of approximately 50,000 years. Groundwater flow and temperature patterns suggest that thermal water flows through a deep system crossing both sedimentary and metamorphic lithotypes along a fracture network associated with the thrust system. This example gives insights into the influences of deep alpine structures and glaciations on groundwater circulation that control the development of many hydrothermal systems not necessarily associated with convective heat flow.

Chemical studies based on main components and trace elements have shown that groundwater circuits in the main hydrothermal systems of Sardinia develop prevalently in the Paleozoic basement both in the presence and absence of deep CO2. The chemical compositions of thermal springs have been 'reconstructed' by w/r interaction processes between cold shallow waters and different sets of minerals in the main reservoirs at different thermal conditions. The results obtained so far show: 1) that temperature plays a small role in defining the solute concentrations in the studied systems, because the reservoir temperatures are all around 100 degreesC, while pH variations (6.7 to 9.0) and total salinity are controlled by the CO2 pressure in the solutions; and 2) that the mineral assemblages are very similar to each other in spite of existing differences in the geological setting of the thermal areas.

It was established that the thermal waters (62.1-97.1 degrees C) with total mineralization of 255-659 mg/dm(3) of HCO3-Na composition are supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals (calcite, magnesite, and dolomite) and saturated with respect to albite, microcline, laumontite, and glaucophane. The waters with the outlet temperature of 24.3-34.5 degrees C, with mineralization 44-87 mg/dm(3) and composition HCO3-Cl-Na-Mg are unsaturated with respect to carbonates and are in the fields of stability of clay minerals: kaolinite, illite, Na-, Ca-, and Mg-montmorillonite. Theseresults are in good agreement with the results of the isotope composition analysis of the hydrothermal vents (delta D, delta O-18 and H-3), according to which the time of water circulation for the first-group is higher than 60 years and may reach more than 1000 years, while for the second-group water it does not exceed 50 years.

According to the selection criteria a total of 42 discharges were sampled, both during winter and summer periods, along major geological units, namely 3 springs at Sete Cidades Volcano, 4 at Nordeste Volcano, 17 at Fogo Volcano, and 18 at Furnas Volcano. Spring water temperature ranges from 12.8 to 78.1 degrees C in winter (mean = 23.6 degrees C), and from 12.6 to 76.7 degrees C in summer (mean = 23.9 degrees C), and the dataset comprehends 26 (winter) to 21 (summer) cold springs, 3 to 8 ortothermal springs, as well as 13 thermal discharges. Mean electrical conductivity is equal to 552.9 mu S/cm (winter) and 550 mu S/cm (summer), suggesting a short residence time, and waters are acidic to slightly basic in character (pH(winter): 4.16-7.16; pH(summer): 4.05-7.35). Groundwater chemistry is manly controlled by silicate leaching, enhanced by the water temperature, seawater spraying and by the active volcanic environment. Rn-222 content ranges between 0.99 and 551.64 Bq/L (mean = 47.8 Bq/L) in winter and between 1.42 and 559.67 Bq/L (mean = 49.4 Bq/L) in summer. All the springs with anomalously higher values are located in Fogo Volcano, while the lowest radon concentrations are observed at Furnas Volcano. Groundwater temperature exerts a control over the Rn-222 concentration; thus, the lower content corresponds to the most mineralized thermal waters. Springs with the higher radon content show the radiogenic contribution from uranium-rich peralkaline syenite intrusive body. Furthermore, data reveal that besides this lithologic control some waters are influenced by Rn-222 migration from a deeper source towards shallower aquifers, carried by a volatile flux of CO2.

Geothermal energy is one such potential source, which needs to be explored. This study deals with the geochemical characteristics and reservoir parameters of the major hot springs located in four diverse terrains in India, as well as their energy potential in terms of reservoir temperature. The west coast springs have mostly Na-Cl, Ca-SO4, and Na-HCO3 water types, and are likely to be influenced by seawater intrusion through deep penetrating faults and fractures, whereas the Odisha hot springs show immature water of Na-Cl, Ca-HCO3 types. The West Bengal springs show Na-Cl-HCO3 water type, presumably derived from dissolution of albite at higher temperatures at depths (similar to 1.13 km). The Himalayan springs water are mostly of NaHCO3, CaHCO3, NaCl, and CaSO4 types, and are geochemically more diversified compared to the west coast, West Bengal, and Odisha hot springs.

This assumption would be acceptable except in specific situations, such as bathing in a radon hot spring where the radon concentration in thermal water is far higher than that in air. The present study focused on such a situation in order to better understand the biokinetics of radon. To mathematically express the entry of radon through the skin into the body, we first modified the latest sophisticated biokinetic model for noble gases. Values of an important parameter for the model-the skin permeability coefficient K (m s(-1))-were derived using data from previous human studies. The analysis of such empirical data, which corresponded to radon concentrations in the air exhaled by subjects during and following bathing in radon-rich thermal water, revealed that the estimated K values had a log-normal distribution. The validity of the K values and the characteristics of the present model are then discussed. Furthermore, the impact of the intake of radon or its progeny via inhalation or skin absorption on radiation dose was also assessed for possible exposure scenarios in a radon hot spring. It was concluded that, depending on the radon concentration in thermal water, there might be situations in which the dose contribution resulting from skin absorption of radon is comparable to that resulting from inhalation of radon and its progeny. This conclusion can also apply to other therapeutic situations (e.g. staying in the pool for a longer period).

Downstream gradients in water chemistry, isotopic composition and carbonate precipitation rates have been documented for the Troll spring and travertine terrace system. The main controls on the downstream evolution of these parameters are carbon dioxide degassing, calcite precipitation, evaporation and biological activity. The carbonate precipitation rates not only show an approximately parabolic dependence on the calcite supersaturation levels, but depend also on local hydrodynamics. Downstream loss of light isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen can be explained as an effect of evaporation, as estimated using chloride as a conservative marker. Biological activity affects nitrate and bromide concentrations and influences the morphology of calcite precipitates.

Corbicula abundance varied seasonally as well as annually, but peaked in 1992. Winter survival of clams was positively correlated with the average winter water temperature and negatively correlated with frequency of daily mean water temperatures less than or equal to1degreesC and with frequency of daily mean April spring freshet flows greater than or equal to1700 m(3)/s. Higher winter survival at Middletown Station sites during most years, when compared with survival near Connecticut Yankee, was attributed to the influence of the Middletown Station thermal discharge. Thermal discharge did not support a permanent population at Connecticut Yankee because of temperature extremes during power plant operation in summer. Clam growth under ambient river temperatures began in May when water temperatures exceeded 10degreesC and ceased in December when temperatures fell below this threshold. Cooling water discharges altered this seasonal growth pattern: growth began in November, as temperatures fell below 35degreesC, and ceased in the summer, when discharge temperatures exceeded this upper thermal threshold. Reproduction occurred in the river when water temperatures were between 17degreesC and 28degreesC, typically from June to October. Peak spawning occurred in August. Discharge temperatures shifted clam reproduction back to spring (March to May). The key to Corbicula's success in establishing a population in the Connecticut River is its ability to colonize refugia from winter temperature and spring freshet flow extremes that often cause high clam mortality.

In comparison to longer-term observations from the pre-impoundment period, the seasonal flow variability was significantly affected by the larger, upstream-located Xiluodu reservoir, with higher discharge in spring and reduced discharge in summer. The smaller, downstream located Xiangjiaba reservoir did not contribute significantly to the total hydrological alteration caused by the reservoir cascade. Thermal stratification occurred in spring and summer in the Xiluodu reservoir, but was not observed in the Xiangjiaba reservoir. The vertical structure and seasonal dynamics of thermal stratification were mainly governed by the water temperature of the inflow and the depth of the water outlet. Despite the different thermal structure, both reservoirs reduced the amplitude of annual temperature variations and delayed the seasonal temperature cycle in the downstream river water. In contrast to discharge variation, thermal effects were cumulative along the cascading reservoirs. Homogenization and delay effects can be expected to increase further with the completion of ongoing reservoir construction upstream of the two studied reservoirs. Based on our findings, we discuss the larger-scale impacts of cascading hydropower developments and emphasize the need for taking water temperature and its variation into account when developing optimized operation or mitigation strategies for these systems.

Climate Change Simulations Predict Altered Biotic Response in a Thermally Heterogeneous Stream System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WATER TEMPERATURE MODEL; SMALLMOUTH BASS; AIR-TEMPERATURE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; BULL TROUT; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; PREY CONSUMPTION; PATCH DYNAMICS; BROOK TROUT; COHO SALMON	Climate change is predicted to increase water temperatures in many lotic systems, but little is known about how changes in air temperature affect lotic systems heavily influenced by groundwater. Our objectives were to document spatial variation in temperature for spring-fed Ozark streams in Southern Missouri USA, create a spatially explicit model of mean daily water temperature, and use downscaled climate models to predict the number of days meeting suitable stream temperature for three aquatic species of concern to conservation and management. Longitudinal temperature transects and stationary temperature loggers were used in the Current and Jacks Fork Rivers during 2012 to determine spatial and temporal variability of water temperature. Groundwater spring influence affected river water temperatures in both winter and summer, but springs that contributed less than 5% of the main stem discharge did not affect river temperatures beyond a few hundred meters downstream. A multiple regression model using variables related to season, mean daily air temperature, and a spatial influence factor (metric to account for groundwater influence) was a strong predictor of mean daily water temperature (r(2) = 0.98; RMSE = 0.82). Data from two downscaled climate simulations under the A2 emissions scenario were used to predict daily water temperatures for time steps of 1995, 2040, 2060, and 2080. By 2080, peak numbers of optimal growth temperature days for smallmouth bass are expected to shift to areas with more spring influence, largemouth bass are expected to experience more optimal growth days (21 - 317% increase) regardless of spring influence, and Ozark hellbenders may experience a reduction in the number of optimal growth days in areas with the highest spring influence. Our results provide a framework for assessing fine-scale (10 s m) thermal heterogeneity and predict shifts in thermal conditions at the watershed and reach scale.

A periodic monitoring of discharge rate, EC, water temperature, and pH was performed in one of them (Lower Anzur spring) and water samples were collected for chemical analysis. Physicochemical data were used to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the functioning of the system. Temporal evolution of the controlled parameters reveals a markedly karst behavior. PCA has defined two principal factors, one related to salinity and other linked to infiltration processes (NO3-, Ca2+). The slight thermal anomaly and the high mineralization registered indicate the existence of ascending regional groundwater flows of long residence time, which would converge into the spring, mixed with recently infiltrated water that circulated through a conduit network formed in the evaporite rocks.

Digital image processing of Landsat data facilitated the identification of water outflows. Thermal anomalies have been detected by visual interpretation in the coastal areas. Ai-photographs interpreted to map linear features and analyze the tectonic structure. A DEM along with field geological data used to verify the results and model the information. Water outflow patterns along coastal areas can be seen or inferred from the satellite images. Thermal anomalies due to water outflows have been identified on the FCC of thermal - with mid - infrared bands. These coincide with areas where fresh water outflows or liquid pollution wastes are found. Discharges of thermal waters into the sea have been detected corresponding, mainly, to coastal springs. Combined interpretation of Landsat data with air-photographs identified the main sources of water outflows and the regional tectonic structure. Such data constitute an ideal base for these studies by comparison or superposition with the other data, and effectively monitor changes in regional scales. Regional hydr -geological or geothermic investigations could be helped by the results of this study.

In this study, the concentrations of radon and thoron in thermal baths at a spa in Dehloran (Iran) were investigated. The concentrations of dissolved Ra-226 in samples of water from thermal baths were also measured.

In addition, the search for a link between the concentration of naturally occurring radionuclides in soil and the use of water from hot springs for irrigation was one of the main goals of the study. The activity concentrations of three major naturally occurring radionuclides in soil samples were measured; the ranges for K-40, Ra-226 and Ra-228 were 101 +/- 8 to 240 +/- 12, 276 +/- 7 to 322 +/- 12 and 20 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 10 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. Higher activity concentrations of Ra-226 and Ra-228 were recorded in soil samples irrigated with hot spring water. The water from the same spring was used in all thermal baths so concentrations of dissolved Ra-226 in water samples from different thermal baths were approximated to also be 0.42 +/- 0.20 Bq.l(-1).

The ventilation and centralized heating systems at the spa under investigation are inefficient so the radon concentrations in the therapy rooms and baths are high.

Two different geothermal waters, both of Na-HCO3 type have been recognized. The first, discharged by the boiling springs located along the western shores of the lake, comes from a shallow steam-heated thermal aquifer. Its temperature is close to 100-degrees-C, as indicated by chalcedony solubility, while the chloride content of these waters is slightly higher than 200 mg L-1. The second, recognizable in the southernmost boiling springs, is representative of a deeper and hotter geothermal reservoir. The occurrence of mixing and boiling processes complicates the interpretation of geochemical data. Nevertheless, a chloride content of about 660 mg L-1, an equilibrium temperature close to 170-degrees-C and a high carbon dioxide partial pressure, at least 10-20 bar, have been estimated for the deep geothermal reservoir.

Chemical, isotopic and mineralogical analyses, and thermodynamic calculations were undertaken to elucidate the processes involved in the formation of these deposits. Hydrous iron oxide particles rich in Al, Si, Ca and As are the first to form in the springs. Accompanying the iron oxides are layered carbonate deposits, composed mainly of well-crystallised calcite. SEM examination of both oxides and carbonates sampled at the outlet of the springs shows that they basically consist of grape-shaped agglomerates of small (300 nm to 1 mu m) anhedral crystals. Light acid etching of these agglomerates reveals colonies of spherical nannobacteria. Water trace partitioning between oxide and carbonate favours the hydrous oxide with As, Pb, Zn, Th concentration. The microscopic features of both types of deposit indicate that microbial mediation probably contributes to their formation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These waters have thousands of milligrams per liter total dissolved solid concentrations and are highly charged with carbon dioxide gas. The spring waters are cold (similar to12 degreesC) and there is no local, deep-seated thermal anomaly. They emerge through thick shale caprock along the surface expression of normal faults. The delta(13)C (-5.8parts per thousand to +0.8parts per thousand Vienna Peedee belemnite) of the dissolved inorganic carbon and elevated He-3/He-4 ratios suggest that the source of the CO2 is the mantle or an ancient deep crystallized igneous melt. The stable isotopic content of the spring waters defines a mixing line between modern local meteoric waters (delta similar to 70parts per thousand) and a component with heavier deltaD but similar delta(18)O values. This trend and that of Sr-87/Sr-86 of dissolved strontium versus 1/Sr are consistent with the hypothesis that Canadian Shield-type brines contribute salinity to the springs. These brines plausibly migrate from the Adirondack Mountains to the topographically low McGregor fault system in the Hudson River lowlands, where the Saratoga springs discharge.

In order to solve the general mixing equation, a software tool, KYBL-7, was developed; its computational methodology is generally based on the balance of selected components of mine waters in steady state conditions, without considering chemical reactions. This approach was applied in the Sokolov Coal Basin, which is situated in the immediate vicinity of Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary), a worldwide renowned spa in the northern part of the Czech Republic. The technology and coal mining methods used in the Sokolov Coal Basin are limited due to its proximity to the Carlsbad thermal springs. Because of their social and economic significance, these springs are protected. Calculations proved that the Carlsbad waters contribute approximately 3 % to the mine water. The imbalance in the mine water mixture using known source waters was quantified by including an 'unknown source' in the mixture simulation. Geochemical modelling demonstrated that the water quality is a result of geochemical reactions of waters in contact with the atmosphere and the reverse dissolution of the accumulated precipitates in the open pit areas. Those results have been used to assess future technical measures that can be taken to protect the Carlsbad thermal waters.

A pool adjacent to a sinkhole was filled with approximately 13,000 L of water. The water was heated, and salt, deuterium oxide, and uranine were added. The pool was then emptied into the sinkhole, and data were collected at Freiheit Spring approximately 95 m north of the sinkhole to monitor changes in discharge, temperature, conductivity/chloride, delta D, uranine, and suspended sediment. This combined trace demonstrated the feasibility and utility of conducting superimposed physical, chemical, and isotopic traces. Flow peaked first at the spring and was followed by a suspended sediment peak; then essentially identical uranine, chloride, and delta D peaks; and finally a temperature peak. The initial increase in flow at the spring recorded the time at which the water reached a submerged conduit, sending a pressure pulse to the spring at the speed of sound. The initial increase in uranine, chloride, and delta D at the spring recorded the arrival of the recharge water. The initial change in temperature and its peak occurred later than the same parameters in the uranine, chloride, and delta D breakthrough curves. As water flowed along this flow path, water temperature interacted with the aquifer, producing a delayed, damped thermal peak at the spring. The combination of conservative and nonconservative tracers illustrates unique pressure, advective, and interactive processes.

New oxygen (18 0) and hydrogen (2 H) isotope data indicate that these waters result from meteoric water infiltration in the Middle Atlas and Rif mountains, circulating at shallow depths in sedimentary rocks. A SiO2-temperature plot of all the spring data shows that silica values fall around the quartz and chalcedony solubility lines, so they are undersaturated with respect to cristobalite and amorphous silica at these temperatures. The waters are in equilibrium with dolomite in carbonate-rock systems and kaolinite in silicate-rock systems.

As an active system, it is a good natural laboratory to study ongoing precipitation processes. Because of anthropogenic influence and the complexity of spring environments, it is challenging to reveal all the governing factors in the process of precipitation. In situ experiments, i.e. artificially controlled natural systems simplify the complexity by adding, excluding or stabilizing influencing parameters during the experiment. CO2 degassing drives changes in the physicochemical parameters of spring waters from the discharge along their flow path. The rate and spatial extension of these changes depend on local hydrogeological, geological, climatic, topographical etc. factors, affecting precipitation processes. In this study, two one-day-long in situ experiments were executed to examine the physicochemical parameter changes of thermal water in a tunnel. The integration of the results with reactive transport models revealed the physicochemical processes of ingassing and degassing and predicted CaCO3 precipitation along the flow path. Small-scale roughness of the channel surface seemed to further influence pH and concentration of HCO3 (-). After 6 weeks of thermal water flowing, organic precipitate (biofilm) formed close to the discharge and then, with a sharp change, inorganic precipitate (calcite) dominates a bit further from the discharge. In situ experiments and connected numerical simulations revealed the role of CO2 degassing and calcite precipitation in the changes of physicochemical parameters, but organic precipitates also have to be considered near the discharge.

Activities of the radium isotopes were measured by ultra gamma spectrometry using a low background and high efficiency well type germanium detector whereas those of uranium were counted in an alpha spectrometer. The minimal, maximal and average values are reported here for each water source. The obtained results show that, unlike well waters, the thermal spring waters present relatively low U-238 activities and elevated Ra-226 activities and U-234/U-238 activity ratios. Uranium and radium activities are similar to those published for other non polluting regions of the world. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

A post-eruption study of gases and thermal waters at Okmok volcano, Alaska	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Okmok volcano; Carbon isotopes; Helium isotopes; Volcanic gas; Springs	BENEATH MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN; HELIUM EMISSIONS; CARBON; DISCHARGE; ISOTOPES; CO2	We report here on the first focused study of gas discharges and thermal spring waters at Okmok volcano since the 2008 phreatomagmatic eruptions. Results include the first compositional gas data from Okmok with minimal air contamination and the first data on magmatic carbon in Okmok spring waters. Chemical and isotopic analyses of the waters and gases are used to assess the character of Okmok fluids eight years after the eruptions ceased. Gases from vents on intracaldera Cone C have high concentrations of H-2 and contain H2S rather than SO2, demonstrating the influence of a hydrothermal system, while isotope values of carbon (-10.2 to -8.9 parts per thousand and helium (similar to 8 R-A) confirm the presence of magma-derived volatiles. Estimates of equilibrium temperatures for the Cone C gas are similar to 230 +/- 30 degrees C. A much cooler reservoir with a maximum temperature of -55 degrees C feeds the intracaldera warm springs. Based on discharge measurements of creeks draining the caldera, the total heat output of the warm springs is estimated to be about 32 MW. Gas data from a single location of steaming ground at the Geyser Bight geothermal area southwest of the Okmok Caldera are given. The gas is typical of geothermal gases with high concentrations of H2S and an air-corrected helium isotope ratio of 7.15 R-A. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Rezaei, A; Rezaeian, M; Porkhial, S				Rezaei, Abolfazl; Rezaeian, Mahnaz; Porkhial, Soheil			The hydrogeochemistry and geothermometry of the thermal waters in the Mouil Graben, Sabalan volcano, NW Iran	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Hydrothermal; Geochemistry; Geothermometry; Environmental isotopes; Sabalan Mount; Iran	ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; MINERAL EQUILIBRIA; SPRINGS; GEOCHEMISTRY; SILICA; FIELD; O-18; AREA; PH	The emerging temperature of thermal springs within the Mouil Graben in the Sabalan volcano, a primary prospect for a geothermal power plant in Iran, varies from about 24 to 80 degrees C. The investigation was carried out by analyzing hydrogeochemistry (i.e., main cations and anions, trace elements and heavy metals) and environmental isotopes (i.e., delta O-18, delta H-2, tritium, and delta C-18) of water from cold and thermal springs, deep wells and the Khiavchay River over the period from 1979 to 2016. The results were also combined with those from a geo-structural survey. The findings reveal that the ascending geothermal fluids around the summit of the Sabalan volcano primarily move into the Mouil Graben fault system where the intersection of the caldera rim faults and the main oblique-slip faults occur at the lowest topographic elevation around the volcano as an emergent dome. The waters in the graben can be categorized into four clusters G1 to G4. The thermal springs which are categorized into groups G1 and G2 result from the contribution of geothermal waters and/or the condensation of the geothermal steam into near-surface waters. The spring waters of group G1 are characterized by being of the chloride water type with the highest values for temperature and EC. The waters of this group predominantly result from the contribution of geothermal water and are then more appropriate for geothermometry. The spring waters of group G2 are characterized by acidic-sulfate water type with lower values for temperature and EC. The waters of this group which predominantly arise from the condensation of geothermal steam, are mainly cold and enriched by H2S into near-surface waters or steam heated waters and are not appropriate for thermometry. Notably, delta O-18 of the GI water samples has a significant positive shift while in the G2 water samples there is either no shift or a small positive shift. The cold spring waters with a low delta O-18 ratio (G3 and G4) originate from precipitation percolated into the surrounding highlands. Moreover, it can be concluded that the controlling silica phase in the Mouil reservoir is quartz and the average temperature calculated by the quartz geothermometer (maximum steam loss) for the water samples from the deep wells is about 225-230 degrees C which is near the range of values determined in the deep wells (230-242 degrees C). The temperatures calculated for the water samples from the deep wells by the cation geothermometers of Na-K (169-349 degrees C), Na-K-Ca 174 to higher than 300 degrees C), Na-K-Ca-Mg (268 to higher than 350 degrees C), Mg-Li (167-266 degrees C), and Na-Li (226-258 degrees C) are higher than the temperature range determined in the deep wells (230-242 degrees C). The average temperature calculated for the water samples from the springs of group G1 using all the silica geothermometers ( < 196 degrees C) and the cation geothermometers of Na-K (236-290 degrees C), Na-K-Ca (194-221 degrees C), Na-K-Ca-Mg (more than 350 degrees C), and Mg-Li (similar to 64-126 degrees C) is different from the temperature range measured in the deep wells except that calculated by the Na-Li geothermometer (173-250 degrees C and 226 degrees C on average) which is relatively close to the measured range. The common discharging gas from the deep wells is CO2 (about 98% of the total gas). It seems that the volatile gases discharging from the deep wells come from a mixture of crustal/mantle and meteoric gas. The deep well gas samples lie well below the air saturation water line.

Hydrogeothermal modelling vs. inorganic chemical composition of thermal waters from the area of Carballino (NW Spain)	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							NATURAL-WATERS; GEOCHEMISTRY; BORON; LITHIUM; SPRINGS; ORIGIN	Hydrothermic features in Galicia (northwest Spain) have been used since ancient times for therapeutic purposes. A characterization of these thermal waters was carried out in order to understand their behaviour based on inorganic pattern and water-rock interaction mechanisms. In this way 15 thermal water samples were collected in the same hydrographical system. The selected thermal water samples were classified using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis in two groups according to their chemical composition: group I with the young water samples and group II with the samples with longest water-rock contact time. This classification agreed with the results obtained by the use of geothermometers and hydrogeochemical modelling, where the samples were classified into two categories according their residence time in the reservoir and their water-rock interaction.

According to Piper diagrams, pH values, field occurrences and water-rock interactions, these hot springs can be classified into three types: (1) Type I, SO42- acidic water where the reservoir is located in the Wuchishan Formation; (2) Type II, HCO3- a near neutral spring where waters originate from the volcanic terrane (andesite); and (3) Type III, Cl- -rich acidic water where waters emanate from shallower Wuchishan Formation. In terms of isotopic ratio, delta D and delta O-18 values, two groups of hot spring can be recognized. One is far away from the meteoric water line of the Tatun area with values ranging between -26.2 parts per thousand and -3.5 parts per thousand, and from -3.2 parts per thousand to 1.6 parts per thousand, respectively. However, another close to the meteoric water line of the Tatun area is between -28.4 parts per thousand and -13.6 parts per thousand, and from -5.5 parts per thousand to -4.2 parts per thousand, respectively. In addition, the delta S-34 value of thermal waters can also be distinguished into two groups, one ranging from 26.1 parts per thousand to 28.5 parts per thousand, and the other between 0.8 parts per thousand and 7.8 parts per thousand. Based on field occurrences and geochemical characteristics, a model has been proposed to illustrate the origin of these hot springs.

Advancements in spring frost protection to sustain cranberry production in Massachusetts	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							COLD-ACCLIMATION; FREEZING TOLERANCE; IRRIGATION; WINTER; WATER	American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is a perennial woody plant that produces buds on short vertical branches known as uprights. These buds must overwinter to acquire adequate winter hardening for protection against frost damage in the spring. Once buds have broken dormancy, the plant requires protection from cold temperatures and desiccating winds. In this study, we evaluated three thermal time models, or growing degree day (GDD) models, as decision tools for initiating spring frost protection, and two methods for applying irrigation for spring frost protection (conventional vs. cycling). We found that the WI(30-5) thermal time model provided the most accurate estimates of the phenology of buds in both normal and abnormal spring temperature years. Although irrigation cycling resulted in slightly higher bud damage, it did not reduce fruit yield. This finding is consistent with bud damage localized in one to two floral initials, with the remaining two to four initials producing flowers and berries comparable to beds with conventional irrigation. In addition to not differences in fruit yield, water savings of up to 35% were obtained in cycled frost irrigation compared with conventional frost irrigation.

Spring mires fed by hot artesian water in Kruger National Park, South Africa	MIRES AND PEAT			English	Article						artesian water; erosion; hydrology; peat domes		This article describes two spring mire complexes in the Kruger National Park (South Africa) that are fed by thermal water with a temperature of 37-42 degrees C. The mires are small (1-20 m in diameter). The peat thickness is 1-2.5 m, of which 1-1.5 m is elevated above the surroundings. Some of the domes have dried out severely and show signs of erosion due to water flow and trampling by large animals. The mires lie in an almost straight line, supporting the hypothesis that the water originates from deep aquifers which discharge at geological faults. The long-term existence of these spring mire complexes may not be threatened because young stages of mire formation are present, but research to elucidate the timescales of peat development is needed to make a valid prognosis.

The assessment of trace metals in surface water showed that the maximum values of Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Pb in Wadi Tinja as a result of the solid mining accumulation wastes after the processing of the Pb-Zn and the mineral paragenesis associated with hydrothermal metalliferous conditions of Jebel Ichkeul, added to these the uncontrolled releases of domestic, industrial and agricultural waste water.

J	Campbell, KA; Rodgers, KA; Brotheridge, JMA; Browne, PRL				Campbell, KA; Rodgers, KA; Brotheridge, JMA; Browne, PRL			An unusual modern silica-carbonate sinter from Pavlova spring, Ngatamariki, New Zealand	SEDIMENTOLOGY			English	Article						calcite; hot spring; opal-A; silica sinter; spicular microstromatolite	TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE; KENYA RIFT-VALLEY; HOT-SPRINGS; NORTH-ISLAND; CALCITE; PRECIPITATION; ONCOIDS; MINERALOGY; CRYSTALS; WAIKITE	A silica-carbonate deposit is forming from the dilute alkali chloride waters of Pavlova spring, a small thermal pool and outflow channel (85 to <40 degreesC), situated at the northern extent of the South Orakonui area of the Ngatamariki geothermal field, Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand. It is one of a small but growing number of thermal spring features known to yield deposits of mixed mineralogy. At Pavlova, a distinctive, crustose, chalk-white, meringue-like sinter, comprising non-crystalline opal-A silica with subordinate calcite, is actively precipitating both around the margins of and as small islets within the spring, with an average accumulation rate of approximate to 2 mm year(-1) . Both emergent and partly submerged substrates host the sinter, including fallen pine branches, twigs, needles and cones, gum leaves, grass blades, bracken fronds, pumice, sediment and microbial mats. The sinter is thin (25-35 mm thickness), finely laminated and contains three distinct types of stacked horizons. Submerged basal layers constitute stratiform to undulatory microstromatolites with pseudocolumns, which grew outwards and upwards on narrow twig nuclei. Emergent middle layers comprise discontinuous, spicular microstromatolites (to 10 mm height), with prostrate and erect microbial filaments, silica spheres and silicified mucus, overlain by silicified structures of probable fungal origin. In places, lower and middle sinter layers are capped by white, smooth, convex surfaces that coalesce into subdued, curved ridges, resembling laterally continuous peaks of egg-white meringue. The meringue is internally laminated, with fossilized microbes preserved in thin horizons. Small lensoid masses of calcite crystals nestle between silica laminae throughout the sinter. The near-neutral (pH approximate to 7.2) spring water is a dilute chloride-carbonate type (HCO3- approximate to 470 mug g(-1) , Cl- approximate to 600 mug g(-1) ) with low SO42-(approximate to 50 mug g(-1) ), typical of TVZ thermal fields where deep chloride fluid mixes with CO2 -rich, steam-heated shallow waters before discharge. The hot water changed little in composition from 1993 to 1999 and, despite dilution by meteoric waters, contains sufficient SiO2 (approximate to 220 mug g(-1) ) for opal-A to deposit at the surface upon cooling. However, the concentration of Ca2+ (approximate to 6 mug g(-1) ) is such that the precipitation of calcite is not expected without modification of spring waters. Precipitation occurs by evaporation of thin water films at exposed substrate surfaces, via meniscoid as well as capillary creep (wicking), through porous sinter horizons and across emergent vegetative surfaces in contact with spring water or steam. The height of the deposit above the water surface is restricted by the upper limit of moisture bathing these substrates. Splash and spray are not involved in the formation of Pavlova spicular microstromatolites, as is the case for other texturally similar deposits from hotsprings elsewhere.

J	JEWELL, PW; RAHN, TA; BOWMAN, JR				JEWELL, PW; RAHN, TA; BOWMAN, JR			HYDROLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF THERMAL WATERS NEAR WELLS, NEVADA	GROUND WATER			English	Article								Anomalously warm water in shallow wells and surface springs is found in and around the town of Wells, Nevada. The geology of the Wells area is dominated by Paleozoic and Miocene sedimentary rocks which are cut by high angle normal faults. Thermal springs are associated with the normal faults, whereas thermal water from wells is the result of upward vertical fluid infiltration through the porous, Miocene lacustrine sedimentary rocks and Quaternary alluvium. Temperature logs from a nearby oil exploration well show locally high geothermal gradients (> 50-degrees-C/km). Analysis of static water heads indicates that vertical flow is greater than or equal to horizontal flow in low-lying areas near the town of Wells. Solution of the advection-diffusion equation using temperature data from the upper portion of the oil well suggests upward flow velocities of approximately 2-10 m/yr. Cold waters have a mixed cation-bicarbonate chemistry whereas thermal waters are dominantly (Na + K)-bicarbonate. Chemical geothermometers indicate fluid circulation to depths between 1-2 km. Deuterium and oxygen-18 analyses have considerable variability, with modest deviations from the global meteoric water line. The occurrence of deuterium as light as - 145 part per thousand suggests significant recharge to the hydrothermal system from very high elevations or water which has had a long subsurface residence time and is recording the signal of a cooler climate.

Occurrences of thermal springs were known to exist in the Toplita area, due to the existence of two old spa and geothermal gradient data maps. In order to locate a new borehole, geophysical investigations consisting in apparent resistivity measurements were carried out in two areas within Toplita City. Due to the local constrains (private properties, infrastructure, fences) measurements were performed mainly in areas where exploitation of new thermal springs would have been possible. The recent geophysical measurements included apparent electrical resistivity investigations. Techniques deployed for field data acquisition were Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES). Following the low apparent resistivity anomalies, evidences of high permeability zones were noticed on resulted sections and models. Three locations were delineated as possible bearing thermal groundwater. Despite their close locations, differences in electrical resistivity data were noticed both on ERT and VES data. After advanced data processing on ERT data, it was concluded that only one of them was bearing mineralized and moderate temperature water. In the selected location, a borehole (210m) was drilled and successfully located a thermal spring, having the highest temperature among known thermal water occurrences in the City area.

J	Aiuppa, A; Carapezza, ML; Parello, F				Aiuppa, A; Carapezza, ML; Parello, F			Fluid geochemistry of the San Vicente geothermal field (El Salvador)	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						geochemistry; thermal springs; fumaroles; San Vicente; El Salvador	SYSTEMS	The volcano Chichontepeque (San Vicente) is one of the nine recent volcanoes making up the El Salvador sector of the WNW-ESE-trending active Central American volcanic belt. Thermal activity is at present reduced to a few thermal springs and fumaroles. The most important manifestations (Agua Agria and Los Infernillos Ciegos) are boiling springs and fumaroles located on the northern slope of the volcano (850 m a.s.l.) along two radial faults. The chloride acid waters of the Los Infernillos area are partly fed by a deep hydrothermal aquifer (crossed at 1100-1300 m by a geothermal exploration well), which finds a preferential path to the surface through the radial fault system. CO2 is the most important gas (>90%) of the Los Infernillos Ciegos and Agua Agria fumaroles. Part of the Los Infernillos gases may also come from a deeper, hotter source, given their high HCl/S-tot. ratio and their more reducing conditions. The application of geothermometric and geobarometric methods to the gases and thermal waters suggests that both thermal areas are linked to the identified 1100-1300 m reservoir, whose temperature (250 degrees C), lateral extension and chemical composition, as resulting from this study, are of interest for industrial development.

Tracing chlorine sources of thermal and mineral springs along and across the Cascade Range using halogen concentrations and chlorine isotope compositions	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						halogen; stable isotope; chlorine isotope; Cascade Range; thermal springs; hydrothermal	SUBDUCTION-ZONE; CENTRAL OREGON; ARC; WASHINGTON; FLUID; CONSTRAINTS; SEDIMENTARY; SYSTEMATICS; CHEMISTRY; BEHAVIOR	In order to provide constraints on the sources of chlorine in spring waters associated with arc volcanism, the major/minor element concentrations and stable isotope compositions of chlorine, oxygen, and hydrogen were measured in 28 thermal and mineral springs along the Cascade Range in northwestern USA. Chloride concentrations in the springs range from 64 to 19,000 mg/L and delta Cl-37 values range from +0.2 parts per thousand to +1.9 parts per thousand (average = +1.0 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand), with no systematic variation along or across the arc, nor correlations with their presumed underlying basement lithologies. Additionally, nine geochemically well-characterized lavas from across the Mt. St. Helens/Mt. Adams region of the Cascade Range (Leeman et al., 2004, 2005) were analyzed for their halogen concentrations and Cl isotope compositions. In the arc lavas, Cl and Br concentrations from the volcanic front are higher than in lavas from the forearc and backarc. F and I concentrations progressively decrease from forearc to backarc, similar to the trend documented for B in most arcs. delta Cl-37 values of the lavas range from -0.1 to +0.8 parts per thousand (average = +0.4 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). Our results suggest that the predominantly positive delta Cl-37 values observed in the springs are consistent with water interaction with underlying Cl-37-enriched basalt and/or altered oceanic crust, thereby making thermal spring waters a reasonable proxy for the Cl isotope compositions of associated volcanic rocks in the Cascades. However, waters with delta Cl-37 values > + 1.0 parts per thousand also suggest additional contributions of chlorine degassed from cooling magmas due to subsurface vapor-liquid HCl fractionation in which Cl is lost to the aqueous fluid phase and Cl-37 is concentrated in the ascending magmatic HCl vapor. Future work is necessary to better constrain Cl isotope behavior during volcanic degassing and fluid-rock interaction in order to improve volatile flux estimates through subduction zones.

Midway is located in the western Heber Valley, an alluvial-filled intermontane basin behind the crest of the Wasatch Mountains. In addition to streams and thermal springs, groundwater discharges from alluvium, bedrock, and karstified tufa. Evaluation of the thermal system reveals that it has been circulated to depths of similar to 2 km and temperatures of similar to 150degreesC. Most groundwater characteristics of the area can be explained by subsurface mixing between isotopically depleted, Pleistocene-aged thermal water and isotopically enriched, cold, modem, low TDS groundwater. Because the entire system exhibits evidence of mixing, it is possible to define the regional extent of upwelling of thermal water, as well as mixing fractions between the two end-members. The subsurface mixing of thermal and non-thermal waters is highly controlled by the superimposition of local irrigation recharge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, experiments were conducted to test the response of Gammarus fossarum Koch, 1836, as an abundant representative of the European spring fauna, to changing water temperatures. The aim was to find out experimentally how G. fossarum reacts to varying and increasing water temperatures. The experiments were conducted in flow channels with spring water. In each flow channel, G. fossarum were placed in boxes with a flow-through system for 4 weeks. Two analytical methods were applied: the feeding activity of the amphipods was quantified in order to determine the reaction of G. fossarum on the level of the organism and the respiratory electron transport system (ETS) assay was conducted in order to determine changes in the test organisms on the cellular level. The results show that the feeding activity of G. fossarum increased with increasing water temperature, up to an optimum, indicating an increase in their metabolic activity. The ETS activity does not show significant differences at the different temperatures tested. A possible explanation for this is the ability of the organisms to adapt quickly to the changed environmental circumstances.

Considerations based on mass balances, element ratios, and Cl-36/Cl and I-129/I ratios suggest that halogens discharged through the thermal springs in the Cascade Range are probably derived from magma degassing. Our results indicate that < 35% of the subducted Cl and < 20% of the subducted Br and I could be transported through arc volcanism and the thermal springs, a considerably lower percentage than estimated for other volcanic arcs along the Pacific Rim. A likely explanation for this difference is that a large fraction of the halogens is released from the slab at shallow depths into the serpentinized sub-forearc mantle because of the relatively high temperatures in the subducting Juan de Fuca plate. The small fraction of halogens subducted to depth probably also indicates a low rate of water transport, which is consistent with the observation that the Cascade Range sub-arc mantle is relatively dry and has a low degree of volcanic vigor, compared with other arcs.

J	Sakai, M; Hoshi, G; Wakiya, R				Sakai, Masaru; Hoshi, Gosuke; Wakiya, Ryoshiro			Ecosystem Functions of a Spring-Fed Tributary in Providing Foraging Habitat and Thermal Refuge for Juvenile Masu Salmon	ICHTHYOLOGY AND HERPETOLOGY			English	Article							COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; STREAMS; TROUT; KARST	The stable flow and temperature regimes of spring-fed streams are expected to provide unique foraging habitats and thermal refuges for fishes, but little is known about the seasonal utilization of spring-fed streams by fishes. Here, we investigated the seasonal changes in population density and stomach contents of juvenile Oncorhynchus masou masou in adjacent clastic lowland spring-fed and runoff tributaries in northern Japan. The results suggested two ecosystem functions of spring-fed streams. First, the stable flow regime of spring-fed streams can create depositional habitats and harbor abundant detritivores, and these macroinvertebrates, in turn, provide a significant food resource for juvenile fishes. Second, the stable temperature regime of spring-fed streams provides thermal refuges during hot and cold weather. Thus, the cooler spring-fed tributary abundant in aquatic prey forms a peak of juveniles' population density in August (1.3 individuals/m(2)). In November, the juvenile population increased four-fold (5.2 individuals/m2), perhaps affected by the warm environment of the spring-fed tributary. The abundance of eggs spawned by both wild and hatchery-reared O. keta may have also contributed to this increase in population through the provision of a nutritious food resource. We concluded that two ecosystem functions were identified in spring-fed streams in the summer, but additional investigation is required to examine the ecosystem functions in winter. Nevertheless, the results highlight that the heterogeneous environment formed by spring and runoff waters may strongly influence the spatiotemporal predator-prey interactions in river networks.

Therefore, in this study, Golbasi-Turkoglu segment of East Anatolian Fault was continuously monitored by collecting data of different geochemical parameters of spring waters emanating from major fault segments (pH, temperature, conductivity, anion and cation concentrations) and correlating with seismicity. For this purpose, three online spring water observation stations located on the Golbasi-Turkoglu segment of EAFS which is the most important source of earthquakes for Kahramanmaras and its surroundings were established. Physical and chemical changes of the spring waters which are thought to be directly related to the fault were monitored. Spring water temperature and electrical conductivity and pH were measured on an hourly basis, whereas anion-cation concentrations were determined daily from bottled spring water samples. Dense seismology network run under the TURDEP Project (EOS Transactions, 88, 333-334, 2007) in the area provided means for monitoring earthquakes down to magnitude 1. We show that a magnitude 4.2 event (20 August 2008) caused significant changes in the geochemical parameters of a nearby spring. From the geochemical transients determined we conclude that there is a close relation between earthquakes and geochemical parameters of spring waters in the region. In order to see this correlation better, measurements of geochemical parameters should continue in the future	[Kop, Alican; Darbas, Gueldemin; Yalcin, Cihan] Kahramanmaras SutcuImam Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Fac Engn & Architecture, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Ezer, Muhsin] Kahramanmaras SutcuImam Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci & Letters, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Bodur, Mehmet Nuri] Hakkari Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Hakkari, Turkey; [Inan, Sedat; Ergintav, Semih; Seyis, Cemil] TUBITAK Marmara Res Ctr, Earth & Marine Sci Inst, Gebze, Turkey	Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Hakkari University; Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)	Kop, A (corresponding author), Kahramanmaras SutcuImam Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Fac Engn & Architecture, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.	alican@ksu.edu.tr	Inan, Sedat/ABF-4422-2020; Seyis, Cemil/GMJ-0548-2022; BODUR, Mehmet Nuri/B-9304-2016; ergintav, semih/P-9315-2015; Kop, Alican/HZK-8296-2023; ezer, muhsin/S-8320-2017; KOP, Alican/HTR-5208-2023	Inan, Sedat/0000-0001-5639-6831; Seyis, Cemil/0000-0002-6131-9918; BODUR, Mehmet Nuri/0000-0002-8515-0686; ergintav, semih/0000-0001-7080-183X; ezer, muhsin/0000-0001-9459-2446; YALCIN, CIHAN/0000-0002-0510-2992	Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK); Earth and Marine Sciences Institute and Engineering Sciences Research Grant Group (MAG); TUBITAK TARAL 1007 Program; Rectorate of Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; chief of Geotechnical Services and Groundwater Branch office of 20th Regional Directorate of State Hydraulic Works Mehmet Kurucay	Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Earth and Marine Sciences Institute and Engineering Sciences Research Grant Group (MAG); TUBITAK TARAL 1007 Program(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Rectorate of Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University(Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University); chief of Geotechnical Services and Groundwater Branch office of 20th Regional Directorate of State Hydraulic Works Mehmet Kurucay(Ministry of Forestry & Water Affairs - Turkey)	The authors thank the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), and the members of Earth and Marine Sciences Institute and Engineering Sciences Research Grant Group (MAG) for the financial support in the realization of this study.

Thermal waters issue from fractured zones associated with active faults trending N-S. Thermal waters are of Na-HCO3-SO4 type with TDS of 6500 mg/l and with temperatures varying between 40 degreesC and 74 degreesC. The thermal springs have relatively low Cl values (130mg/l), but are rich in Na (1750 mg/l) and HCO3 (2600 mg/l). The dominant water-rock interactions are the carbonate dissolution and ion exchange reactions between Na and Ca and/or Mg resulting an increase in dissolved minerals and conversion into sodium bicarbonate type water. Thermal waters are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and oversaturated for calcite and dolomite giving rise the travertine formation along the fault zone. Assessment of geothermometry results applied thermal waters showed that reservoir temperature is estimated about 120-160 degreesC.

Penetrative granulite facies planar structural fabrics in the northern Eastern Ghats Belt are reoriented within an E-W striking, northerly dipping ductile shear zone that is subsequently dissected by WNW-ESE trending, subvertical pseudotachylite-bearing faults and fractures. Tube and dug wells in the area yield both thermal (similar to 60 degrees C) and nonthermal (similar to 28 degrees C) water. Chemical analyses reveal that the thermal water is richer in Na+, K+, and Cl-, with lower bicarbonate content. Stable isotope analyses (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of the thermal and nonthermal waters both plot on the Global Meteoric Water Line; however, tritium and C-14 ages indicate that the nonthermal water is relatively modern, while the thermal waters are older. This suggests that both waters come from distinct reservoirs. Very low frequency electromagnetic studies show that water circulates through the WNW-ESE trending fracture systems but also exists in isolated pockets within the crystalline country rock. Heat production studies reveal that some host rocks have exceptionally high heat-producing element concentrations, primarily as thorium within the minerals monazite and thorite. Meteoric waters entrapped for longer times near these heat-producing element-rich pockets undergo radiogenic heating, and are shielded from the nonthermal groundwater circulating within the fracture system. The high heat-producing element distribution in the crust resulting from Neoproterozoic geological events has, thus, elevated the present-day equilibrium geotherm in the Eastern Ghats Belt, forming sources for shallow-level, nonvolcanic hot springs within a tectonically inactive terrane.

The fate of urban springs: Pumping-induced seawater intrusion in a phreatic cave	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Spring; Karst; Artesian; Coastal groundwater; Hydrographs; Urban	COASTAL AQUIFER; WATER-INTRUSION; EOGENETIC KARST; SEA-LEVEL; GROUNDWATER; SYSTEM; VULNERABILITY; EVOLUTION; HYDROLOGY; SALINITY	Sulphur Springs Cave is an extensive phreatic cavity that produces a large, historic spring in the middle of metropolitan Tampa, Florida, USA. The city of Tampa extracts groundwater from the spring to supplement municipal water supply and to support low-salinity habitat in the estuarine Hillsborough River. Extraction at this site has occurred for many decades, but has intensified since the early 2000s, rapidly increasing the salinity of the spring and cave water. The purpose of this study was to address the potential sources and mechanisms of saltwater intrusion at this site using historical and current hydrochemical data published in the literature and online by government agencies. We also explored the cave to identify point-sources of intrusion, and collected water and biological samples from inside the cave to identify potential ecosystem impacts of increasing cave salinity. From 1946 to present, Sulphur Springs water shifted from being fresh (specific conductance < 500 mu S cm(-1)) and of calcium-sulfate type to being brackish (specific conductance similar to 5000 mu S cm(-1) and higher) and of sodium-chloride type. We found numerous vents in the cave that issue saline, thermal, sulfidic water and host distinct microbial mat communities. These vents are likely connected to bedrock fractures that provide preferential flow-paths along which confined, deep-sourced saline water enters the freshwater portion of the aquifer, probably originating from the coastal mixing zone. Salinity increased at the spring during dry-season pumping activity and after wet-season recharge events, which likely increased artesian pressure in confined saline aquifer units. Salinization of Sulphur Springs may disrupt the cave microbe and stygobite communities and eventually make the spring unsuitable to maintain low-salinity habitat in the Hillsborough River.

The springs were fitted inside a circular cross-section copper tube. The diameter and length of the copper tube were 25.4 mm and 1820 mm, respectively. The experiments were performed with 9 spiral springs of 12 and 15 mm diameter in four pitches of 2, 5,10,20 mm and 21 mm diameter in three pitches 10, 20 and 30. The fluid used in all experiments was water and the Reynolds number for the hot water flow into the copper tube was in the range of 22,462 to 36,456. Cold water was used to cool around the copper tube and rate of cold water flow was also 0.1547 kg / s. The heat transfer coefficient increased by 45% after the springs were placed inside the copper tube in comparison to the no-spring condition. However, the pressure drop in the worst case increased by 77%. It can also be seen that the heat transfer coefficient increased to 20% by increasing the diameter of the springs by 75%. Meanwhile, the springs with a diameter of 21 mm and 12 mm has the most and the least effect on increasing the heat transfer coefficient, respectively.

In springs with variable flow and where they are associated with minor alterations and fractures, water type is Ca-(Na)-HCO(3)with low total dissolved solids (TDS; 54-200 ppm) and a neutral or slightly acid pH. In springs that have continuous flow and association with relevant fractures, water type is Na-HCO3, with higher pH and TDS (240-563 ppm). There are five springs with water type Na-(Ca)-Cl and high TDS (780-9,205 ppm) near the SCS's southern tectonic borders. Within 5,000 years of apparent residence time, Ca-(Na)-HCO(3)water progresses to Na-HCO(3)type, slightly increasing HCO(3)content, losing Ca due to calcite precipitation and ionic exchange, and gaining S due to sulphate reduction. No changes are observed after 20,000 years of apparent age. The influence of internal CO(2)is compatible with Na-HCO(3)water type characteristics, facilitated by fracturing. Most of the springs yield cold water; thus, a flow depth up to 500 m can be deduced. Only the Messejana-Plasencia fault region shows Na-HCO3-type thermal springs. Chloride type water is a result of the influence of the Tertiary basins' water moving towards the southern border of the SCS. The reverse fault in such contact, together with the subvertical structures affected by it, are responsible for the springs emerging in the granite. The northern border of the SCS shows the opposite behaviour.

A total of 71 algal species belonging to different algal groups like Cyanophyta (34), Bacillariophyta (31) and Chlorophyta (6) were identified from the collected samples. Among cyanophytes, five species were heterocystous, while others belonged either to non-heterocystous filamentous (20) or to unicellular forms (9). The species richness decreases as temperature increases towards the source point of the spring (i.e. from subsite S-5 to S-1). However, Shannon's measured diversity varied little across the subsites except witnessing a sudden drop at S-2. Whittaker's components of diversity, such as beta and gamma diversity, successfully reflected the major changes in the species composition of cyanobacterial and microalgal communities residing in different thermal subsites. Some green algae and diatoms were found thriving well at elevated temperatures (> 38 degrees C). These species need to be studied further for their under-operating cellular mechanisms and encompassing robust biomolecules that might be proven useful in diverse biotechnological processes.

The Xiaojiang fault zone (XJF), situated in a highly deformed area of the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is one of the active seismic areas. In this study, major and trace elements, and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of 28 sites in hot springs along the XJF were investigated from June 2015 to April 2019. The meteoric water acts as the primary water source of the hot spring in the XJF and recharged elevations ranged from 1.8 to 4.5 km. Most of the hot spring water in the study area was immature water and the water-rock reaction degree was weak. The temperature range was inferred from an equation based on the SiO2 concentration and chemical geothermal modeling: 24.3 similar to 96.0 degrees C. The circulation depth for the springs was estimated from 0.45 to 4.04 km. We speculated the meteoric water firstly infiltrated underground and became heated by heat sources, and later circulated to the earth's surface along the fault and fracture and finally constituted hot spring recharge. Additionally, a continuous monitoring was conducted every three days in the Xundian hot spring since April 2019, and in Panxi and Qujiang hot springs since June 2019. There were short-term (4-35 d) seismic precursor anomalies of the hydrochemical compositions prior to the Xundian M(L)4.2, Dongchuan M(L)4.2, and Shuangbai M(L)5.1 earthquakes. The epicentral distance of anomalous sites ranged from 19.1 to 192.8 km. The anomalous amplitudes were all over 2 times the anomaly threshold. The concentrations of Na+, Cl-, and SO42- are sensitive to the increase of stress in the XJF. Modeling on hydrology cycles of hot springs can provide a plausible physicochemical basis to explain geochemical anomalies in water and the hydrogeochemical anomaly may be useful in future earthquake prediction research of the study area.

Cyanobacterial community structure in hot water springs of Indian North-Western Himalayas: A morphological, molecular and ecological approach	ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS			English	Article						Canonical correspondence analysis; Cyanobacteria; Diversity analysis; Hot water springs; 16S rRNA; Morphology	TRUE-BRANCHING CYANOBACTERIA; POLYPHASIC CHARACTERIZATION; THERMOPHILIC CYANOBACTERIA; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; GEOTHERMAL SPRINGS; HIMACHAL-PRADESH; THERMAL SPRINGS; MICROBIAL MATS; FLORA; BAKRESWAR	Cyanobacterial diversity from nine hot water springs of North-Western Himalayas scattered over an area of approximately 20,000 km(2) has been studied using polyphasic approach in relation to important ecological factors. These hot springs have hard water, with variation of temperature from 40 to 90 degrees C and pH from 6.8-8.0. A total of 625 cyanobacterial isolates were cultured from 150 samples. On the basis of morphology, these isolates were represented by 22 species of 11 genera. A total of 220 cyanobacterial isolates representing morpho-species from each sampling site were subjected to molecular characterization by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16S rRNA gene, rbcL gene and cpcB-IGS-cpcA phycocyanin locus region sequencing for elucidating their identity, diversity and phylogenetic relationships. ARDRA analysis revealed 22 groups of cyanobacterial isolates from selected hot water springs. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene, rbcL gene and cpcB-IGS-cpcA phycocyanin locus region revealed that the identity of the majority of the cyanobacterial species was congruent with the identity based on morphological features. The identity of 3 taxa; Leptolyngbya sp. PUPCCC 112.22, Phormidium sp. PUPCCC 118.2 and Phormidium sp. PUPCCC 118.3, based on both morphological features and molecular markers, did not match with known cyanobacterial species, indicating these as new genera/species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that taxa from selected hot springs belonging to Stigonematales are monophyletic, whereas Chroococcales and Oscillatoriales are polyphyletic. Canonical correspondence analysis of physico-chemical parameters and cyanobacterial community of each hot water spring revealed that temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrogen, sulphate and phosphate influenced cyanobacterial community structure. Further, our study has revealed that the cyanobacterial community of hot water springs is comprised of endemic as well as globally distributed representatives and is influenced by ecological parameters. The nature of the cyanobacterial community structure depended on the water chemistry rather than geographical location of the spring.	[Singh, Yadvinder; Singh, D. P.; Khattar, J. I.

J	McMaster, GS; Wilhelm, WW				McMaster, GS; Wilhelm, WW			Phenological responses of wheat and barley to water and temperature: improving simulation models	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CENTRAL GREAT-PLAINS; WINTER-WHEAT; LEAF APPEARANCE; SPRING WHEAT; VEGETATIVE DEVELOPMENT; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; AIR-TEMPERATURE; SHOOT APEX; GROWTH; PHYLLOCHRON	Understanding and predicting small-grain cereal development is becoming increasingly important in enhancing management practices. Recent efforts to improve phenology submodels in crop simulations have focused on incorporating developmental responses to water stress and interpreting and understanding thermal time. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate data from three experiments to (a) determine the qualitative and quantitative response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to water stress and (b) ascertain where in space to measure temperature, to provide information required to improve phenological submodels. The first experiment tested the phenological responses of 12 winter wheat cultivars to water stress for two seasons at two sites. The second experiment tested the timing of water stress on spring barley phenological responses for 2 years. In a third experiment, soil near the shoot apex of field-grown spring wheat was heated to 3 degreesC above ambient soil temperature for three planting dates in each of 2 years, to test whether it is better to use soil or air temperature in calculating thermal time. The general response of wheat and barley to water stress was to reach growth stages earlier (i.e. to hasten development). The most significant response was for the grain filling period. Water stress had little effect on jointing and flag leaf complete/booting growth stages. Thermal time to jointing was highly variable across locations. However, thermal time to subsequent growth stages was very consistent both within and across locations. The winter wheat cultivars tested followed this general response across site-years, but inconsistencies were found, suggesting a complicated genotype by environment (G x E) interaction that makes improving phenology submodels for all cultivars difficult. The G x E interaction was most prominent for anthesis (A) and maturity (M) growth stages. Results of heating the soil at the shoot apex depth were completely unexpected: heating the soil did not speed spring wheat phenological development. These results, and others cited, suggest caution in allocating effort and resources to measuring or estimating soil temperature rather than relying on readily available air temperature as a means of universally improving phenology submodels. These results help quantify the response of wheat to water stress and thermal time for improving crop simulation models and management.

Hydrologic and geochemical survey of the lake "Specchio di Venere" (Pantelleria island, Southern Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						pantelleria island; volcanic lake; gas hazard	SICILY CHANNEL; FLUIDS	Hydrological and geochemical studies performed on Lake Specchio di Venere on Pantelleria island (Italy) indicate that this endorheic basin has been formed through upwelling of the water table, and that it is continuously fed by the thermal springs situated on its shores. The lake is periodically stratified both thermally and in salinity, albeit this stratification is rather unstable over time, since meteorological events such as strong rain or wind can determine the mixing of its waters. Periodical analyses of the lake water chemistry show large variations of the salt content due to the yearly evaporation-rain dilution cycle. These processes are also responsible for the saline stratification during steady meteorological conditions. The mineralogical characterisation of the bottom sediments shows the almost exclusive presence of neoformation minerals, mainly carbonates, formed in response to the pH gradient between spring- (pH approximate to 6) and lake-waters (pH approximate to 9). Finally, the CO2 partial pressures in the lake water slightly exceeding the atmospheric one, are due to the large amounts of CO2 brought to the lake through the bubbling free gas phase of the thermal springs. Nevertheless the high pH value of the lake water, its small volume and its periodical mixing prevent dangerous built up of this gas.

In this paper, we investigated the chemical and isotopic composition of thermal water in an underexploited geothermal belt, Yidun-Litang area, in eastern Tibetan Plateau. 24 hot spring samples from the Yidun and Litang area were collected and analyzed. The water chemical types of the hot springs are mainly Na-HCO3-type water. Water-rock interaction and cation exchange and mixture are the dominant hydrogeochemical processes in the hydrothermal evolution. The significant shift of D and O-18 isotopes from the GMWL indicates that these springs have undergone subsurface boiling before rising to the surface. Different ratios of Cl to other conservation species can be found for the springs in Litang and Yidun areas, suggesting the different heat sources of the two hydrothermal systems. The reservoir temperature in the Yidun area is around 230 degrees C while the reservoir temperature in the Litang area is around 200 degrees C. Both hydrothermal systems are recharged by the meteoric water and are heated by the different deep, thermally and topographically driven convection heat along faults and undergoing subsurface boiling before going back to the surface.

J	SVEINBJORNSDOTTIR, AE; JOHNSEN, SJ				SVEINBJORNSDOTTIR, AE; JOHNSEN, SJ			STABLE ISOTOPE STUDY OF THE THINGVALLAVATN AREA - GROUNDWATER ORIGIN, AGE AND EVAPORATION MODELS	OIKOS			English	Article							WATER	The paper describes the stable isotopic composition of water within the catchment area of Thingvallavatn. The lake is about 90% fed by groundwater springs, mainly entering the lake by the northern shore. These springs have stable isotopic composition considerably lower than the local precipitation, but similar to the present precipitation falling on the southernmost part of the Langjokull ice cap. It is therefore suggested that the spring water originates from Langjokull ice cap but is slightly enriched in the heavier isotopes due to mixing with local precipitation on the 50 km way from the recharge area to the lake. At the southwestern shoreline of the lake several springs have been observed that are luke warm (7-11-degrees-C) due to the geothermal activity at the Nesjavellir field. The oxygen isotopic composition of this water is slightly heavier than observed elsewhere within the catchment area due to contamination by the Nesjavellir thermal fluid, which has become considerably enriched in the heavy isotope O-18 due to oxygen isotopic exchange with the bedrock. In the paper it is shown that the thermal water at Nesjavellir also originates from the Langjokull ice cap. The delta-O-18 - delta-D relation for the waters in open fissures. springs and wells within the Thingvellir National Park follows a line with a similar slope to that of the meteoric line (i.e. 8), but most of the data points lie above the meteoric line. The deuterium excess which is 10 parts per thousand for the meteoric line is 10 to 13 parts per thousand for the Thingvellir water. Seasonal variation in the delta-O-18 value was studied for three fissure springs within thc National Park. For the fissures with the least rainwater component (the Vellankatla springs) the variation is usually very small, whereas the spring Silfra, that has higher local rainwater component, shows more variation. Stable isotope data suggests that 75% of the water in the Vellankatla springs originates in the Langjokull ice cap. Furthermore, it is shown that precipitation within the 5 previous years amounts to about 9% of the Vellankatla flow and that the 25% of the Vellankatla water, which consists of recent precipitation, is younger than 10 vr. Radiocarbon analyses of the water give, on the other hand, an anomalously high age due to influx of CO2 from the mantle. It is shown how evaporation from lakes and ponds can be modelled and studied quantitatively by measuring the deuterium excess. The results demonstrate the importance of studying simultaneously the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and suggest that if the deuterium excess is < 10 parts per thousand the water is isotopically different from its original isotopic composition due to evaporation. This is particularly important to bear in mind when the geographical distribution of delta values in precipitation is being studied and the delta-D values are used to trace the origin of a spring water.

Their accumulated thickness from the Cambrian to the Triassic is in some places as much as 3000 m. Numerous thermal waters (springs and wells) occur in these strongly karstified carbonate massifs. This is the result of significant ancient and present orogenic activity, as the region demonstrates by its strong seismic activity. These karstic formations are water-bearing and strongly recharged by rainfall of between 1600 mm and 2600 mm per year in 90% of the area concerned. In view of the average annual air temperatures ( 17 degreesC-25 degreesC according to the region), 23 sample springs or wells were chosen with water temperatures of between 29 degreesC and 68 degreesC. Hydrochemical characteristics of these thermal waters emerging in different carbonate-rock units were examined by chemical analyses of major ions. In this large region, thermal waters are divided into four hydrochemical types: the Na-Cl type resulting from the intrusion of sea water for distances of up to several kilometres inland and depths of 1000 m, the Ca-SO4 type, probably resulting from the leaching of deposits of metallic sulphides that are widely distributed in these carbonate-rock units, and finally the Ca-HCO3 and Mg-HCO3 types which are chemically similar to fresh karstic waters in limestones and dolostones. The occurrence of these thermal groundwaters as well as their chemical characteristics seem to indicate the existence of large-scale deepseated groundwater flow systems in the karstic aquifers.

Data were collected on a sampling grid of 20 stations on the continental shelf during four cruises (SATIR 8 to 11) between March and June 1982. Haline fronts (Ushant haline front, coastal haline front) were found in late winter and early spring; their outlines follow closely the outlines of the summer thermal fronts. The origin of these haline fronts comes mainly from the outflow towards the English Channel of the waters of the Loire river on the South Brittany shelf. At this time of the year, a conservative mixing is observed between offshore waters with relatively low nutrient concentrations and coastal waters nutrient-enriched by the river inputs. A particularly early phytoplankton development has been observed in March in the haline frontal zones. Nutrient assimilation and phytoplankton development take place sequentially in spring on the Armorican shelf: a time lag of nearly three months exists between the initiation of the bloom in the South Brittany low-salinity waters and in the central part of the continental shelf. The initiation of phytoplankton development results mainly from the establishment of a haline or thermal stratification. A simple model of critical depth (Sverdrup, 1953; Riley, 1957) taking into account the evolution of the global solar irradiance and the depth of the mixed layer permits the prediction of periods of initiation of phytoplankton development on the Armorican shelf and explains the evolution of the nutrient distributions.

Earthquake activity occurs relatively more frequently in the region and is considered to be related to the strong hydrothermal activity. Geothermal waters hosted by a deep fault may provide evidence regarding the deep underground; their aqueous chemistry and isotopic information can indicate the mechanism of thermal springs. Cyclical variations of geothermal water outflows are thought to work under the effect of solid earth tides and can contribute to understanding conditions and processes in underground geoenvironments. This paper studies the origin and variations of the geothermal spring group controlled by the Moxi fault and discusses conditions in the deep ground. Flow variation monitoring of a series of parameters was performed to study the geothermal responses to solid tides. Geothermal reservoir temperatures are evaluated with Na-K-Mg data. The abundant sulfite content, dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) data are discussed to study the oxidation-reduction states. Strontium isotopes are used to trace the water source. The results demonstrate that geothermal water could flow quickly through the Moxi fault the depth of the geothermal reservoir influences the thermal reservoir temperature, where supercritical hot water is mixed with circulating groundwater and can reach 380 degrees C. To the southward along the fault, the circulation of geothermal waters becomes shallower, and the waters may have reacted with metamorphic rock to some extent. Our results provide a conceptual deep heat source model for geothermal flow and the reservoir characteristics of the Moxi fault and indicate that the faulting may well connect the deep heat source to shallower depths. The approach of hot spring variation research also has potential benefits for earthquake monitoring and prediction.(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of the community DNA revealed that the phyla Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia were the most abundant. The bacterial diversity detectable and classifiable was greater when the V4-7 variable region was used compared to the V1-3 region. The most abundant bacteria genera detected with region V1-3 were; Stenotrophomonas (23.3%), Aquaspirillum (5.11%), Zavarzinella (2.73%), Haliscomenobacteria (1.25%), Rheinheimera (1.14%) and Tepidomonas (1.14%). All the other detectable genera were below 0.6%. Genera detected with region V4-7 from most abundant were; Stenotrophomonas (17.96%), Zavarzinella (5.81%), Aquaspirillum (4.75%), Rheinheimera (3.52%), GPI (1.41%), Gemmata (1.41%) and Syntrophobacter (1.06%). All the other genera detected were below 0.7%. Siloam is one of the hottest thermal springs in South Africa (63 degrees C), the water has a pH of 9.5 and is relatively high in fluoride and bromide; it is possible that the physicochemical properties could have some influence on the diversity of bacteria. This article reports on the first phylogenetic analysis of a South African thermal spring bacterial community.

Its occurrence and emergence are strongly controlled by the nearly north-south trending anticlines. The basin-anticline outcropping type groundwater is similar to that of the basin type but also has the characteristics of the outcropping type because of the anticlines. The natural hot springs in the study area exist mainly in the outcropping areas of the carbonates, in the middle and the plunging ends of the anticlines where the topography was cut by rivers. They can also rise through the overlying sandstones and form up-flow springs. Geothermal wells tapping the carbonate reservoirs on the flanks of the anticlines also produce thermal groundwater. The groundwater flow can be divided into three levels: (1) shallow circulation system with groundwater of HCO3-Ca type and low TDS discharging through normal temperature springs, (2) middle circulation system with groundwater of SO4-Ca type and TDS of 2-3 g/L discharging through hot springs and (3) deep circulation system with groundwater of Cl-Na type and high TDS discharging through hot springs or wells.

J	Paikaray, S; Mahajan, T				Paikaray, Susanta; Mahajan, Tanuj			Hydrogeochemical processes, mobilization controls, soil-water-plant-rock fractionation and origin of fluoride around a hot spring affected tropical monsoonal belt of eastern Odisha, India	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fluorosis; Quaternary soil; Ion exchange; Fluoride mobility; Hot spring fluoride	QUALITY ASSESSMENT; GROUNDWATER; DISTRICT; CONTAMINATION; ADSORPTION; DRINKING; REGION; DISSOLUTION; MECHANISMS; CHEMISTRY	Fluorosis, poor crop yield, and degraded soil fertility due to excess fluoride are mostly associated with igneous exposures and fertilizer use. Geochemical, petrographic, microprobe and mineralogical examinations revealed thermal spring origin of fluoride (up to 15.8 mg L-1) affecting agriculture and public health in eastern India. No fluoride was detected in plant leaves and exposed charnockite, but nearby soils and siderite precipitates are enriched in fluoride up to 3.4 g kg -1. Both geogenic hot spring and fertilizer origin are proposed with fluorosis severity found to be closer to the hot spring where the stream, pond, and well enrichments might have resulted upon mixing with high F- hot spring water. The pond, stream, bore well, hand pump, well and hot spring water in the region are mostly fresh water (dissolved solids <1000 mg L-1) and hard to very hard in nature with a pH of 5.7-9.7 and a temperature of 23-55 degrees C. Major water is of NaCl type with minor components of mixed CaMgCl, CaHCO3 and CaCl types enriched in the order Na+>Ca2+approximate to Mg2+>K+>Si4+>FeT > Al3+ and Cl-> HCO3- > NO3- > SO42-> PO43-. Stream, pond, and bore well waters exhibit better suitability for irrigation use compared to hot spring and well waters, while all the studied water resources are of poor to unsuitable quality for human con-sumption. Carbonate weathering dominated silicate weathering processes for the stream, pond, and bore well water, while the latter was for hot spring and well water. Reverse ion exchange is the major process that pre-vailed in the region where rock-water interaction and evaporation governed the regional hydrochemistry. Fluoride mobilization is favored under alkaline conditions and enhanced by competitive anions in the order NO3- > SO42-> PO43-. Acidic rainwater does not favor fluoride release from soil, and F-containing siderite is prone to release fluoride under ambient conditions.

Radiogenic isotopes (H-3, C-14) were used to constrain the groundwater mean residence time and separate different groundwater components. Noble gases, stable isotopes of water (delta O-18, delta H-2), dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13) and dissolved sulfate (delta S-34, delta O-18), and major ion and trace element composition were used to identify the source of water, its chemical evolution and water-rock interactions, as well as to identify the contribution and composition of endogenic gases. This approach was applied to three low-temperature thermal springs located in Mariovo (North Macedonia) associated with fossil hypogene caves, previously identified by morphological and geochemical studies of caves and cave deposits. Based on the obtained results, the main studied springs represent an output part of a regional hypogene karst groundwater system with a deep-circulating (similar to 1 km), old (similar to 15 ka), thermal (>= 60 degrees C) water, which mixes with young (<50 years), cold (<14 degrees C) and shallow epigene karst groundwater. The output parts are structurally controlled, at the interception of low topography and deep faults, along which the groundwater interacts with deep-seated gases, dominantly CO2 of metamorphic origin (delta C-13 of +4.5 parts per thousand VPDB), with some contribution of mantle helium. The thermal karst groundwater interacts at depth with volcanic rocks from the nearby Neogene-Quaternary volcanic complex, as well as with metamorphic basement rocks and granitoids.

More than 90 thermal water samples were collected on a regular basis from 2006 to 2008 to measure element concentrations as a monitor of earthquake precursors. Water samples were analyzed using ICP-MS. The observed B, Ba, Br and Ge concentrations for 16 months are in ranges of 79 similar to 422, 103 similar to 167, 28 similar to 93 and 0.3 similar to 1.2 mu g.L-1, respectively. Chloride concentrations for these periods are in range of 7 similar to 21 mg.L-1. The data identify some element anomalies before earthquakes. These anomalies are characterized by decreases up to 158% in Ba and Cl concentrations. The occurrence of these anomalies can be attributed to stress/strain induced pressure changes in the subsurface water systems. It can be suggested that the thermal springs in the fault line area are ideal sites for precursors of earthquakes.

Hyderogeochemical processes, the origin and fate of arsenic were studied in the Bazman geothermal area. For this purpose, thermal springs, surface and groundwater, and surrounding rocks were sampled and the samples analyzed (main ions, trace elements and stable isotopes). Several samples were also collected from date palms irrigated by this water for As, Cu, Ni and Zn analysis and the associated health risk indices calculated. In general, Bazman springs have a neutral to slightly alkaline pH, is of a predominant Na-Cl water type, and the hydro-chemistry of the springs' water is affected by water-rock interaction, silicate weathering, dissolution and evaporation. The ion exchange diagrams also indicate the influence of cation exchange on the water chemistry in the region. Geochemical and statistical analysis showed that the origin of arsenic and other trace elements in the aquifer is water-rock interaction. It seems that during water ascent to the surface As is transported by arsen-o-carbonate complexes in the Bazman geothermal aquifer. In addition to carbonates, iron-rich minerals such as goethite and hematite also influence the concentration of dissolved arsenic in the spring's water. Arsenic con-centration in sediments and outcropped rocks adjacent to the springs showed that high levels of arsenic con-centration in spring water cannot be related to these rocks and sediments. A recorded high target hazard quotient (THQ) value of arsenic in date samples alarmed the possible adverse health effects for the consumers. Also, hazard index values are higher than unity, invoking a concern for public health.

Constraining the mean transit time (MTT) of relatively modern thermal waters in Deccan volcanic geothermal area, India using tritium tracer	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Mean transit time; Tritium; Lumped parameter models; Thermal waters	RESIDENCE TIME; GROUNDWATER AGE; CATCHMENT; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; STREAM; FLUIDS; CALIBRATION; EVOLUTION; HYDROLOGY	Constraining the mean transit time (MTT) of thermal waters is essential to understand the sustainability and renewal rate of geothermal systems. In this study, tritium concentrations of samples from five thermal water manifestations, three shallow groundwater wells (dug wells) and one deep groundwater (borehole) are analysed at regular time intervals for three years to estimate the MTT of the thermal and non-thermal waters in the Deccan Volcanic geothermal province by using lumped parameter models. The tritium concentrations of the thermal waters are found to vary between 0.77 and 2.77 TU (+/- 0.0.23 TU at 1 sigma) which are lower than those of the shallow non-thermal groundwater (5.4-7.18 TU) (+/- 0.40 TU at 1 sigma) whereas the tritium value for the deep groundwater ranges between 2.30 and 2.78 TU (+/- 0.27 TU at 1 sigma). Among different lumped parameter models, PFM (piston flow model), EMM (exponential mixing model) and EPM (exponential piston flow model) are used to estimate the MTT of the groundwater and thermal waters in the study area. The historical records of weighted mean concentration of tritium in precipitation at the nearby Tural-Rajwadi geothermal area is taken as input function in the modelling procedure. The PFM and EMM models represent the lower and upper case of the EPM model mixing, respectively whereas the values obtained from the EPM models provide the actual range of mean transit times. The overall uncertainty in the MTT estimation has also been computed. The MTT of the younger fraction of the thermal waters in Ganeshpuri thermal water (HS-1) and Akloli thermal water (HS-7) are found to be 70 +/- 5 and 90 +/- 14 years old respectively. The MTT of both the shallow groundwater (DW-1 and DW-3) samples is estimated to be similar to 1.5 years whereas the MTT of the deep groundwater (BH-1) is 39 +/- 6 years. Thermal springs in this area undergo mixing with non-thermal water during its ascent towards the surface as a result binary mixing model has been applied to find the MTT of the mixed thermal spring.

The aim of our study is to know the tectonic mechanisms responsible for the emergencies and to highlight their chemical characteristics of water springs in Setif. Wherein thermalism is characterized by the presence of a number of thermal springs, the latest are usually related to recent large fractures deeply affecting the sedimentary formations and sometimes even crystallin basement. These fractures are often injected by Triassic evaporates; their directions are NNW-SSE, NW-SE, and NE-SW and limiting great structural units. Four groundwater facies were identified: the high percentage of sources, staking major accidents related to limestone mountains or to the basement, shows a calcium or sodium sulfate facies; and the sources are often hot (meso or hyperthermal). A second group, related to terrigenous saliferous formations, shows a sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride facies. The geothermic interpretation allows us to conclude that the reservoir supplies the two aquifer systems of the thermal complex, and is stored in fissured Jurassic limestone, where water storage and circulation is beyond 2600m deep.

Non-native poeciliids in hot water: the role of thermal springs in facilitating invasion of tropical species	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Gambusia; Poeciliidae; United States	MOSQUITOFISH GAMBUSIA-AFFINIS; BELONESOX BELIZANUS; FISH INTRODUCTIONS; UNITED-STATES; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; TOLERANCE; PREDATION; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS	Livebearers in the family Poeciliidae are some of the most widely introduced fishes. Native poeciliid translocations within the U.S. are mostly due to deliberate stocking for mosquito control. Introductions of exotic poeciliids, those not native to the U.S., are more likely to be due to release from aquaria or escape from farms. Many of these non-natives originate from warm climate regions, contrasting with the relatively cold climates in the U.S. Thus, thermal springs may increase the possible range of these species. Our primary objective was to examine the importance of climate and thermal springs in affecting the distribution of translocated and non-native poeciliids in the U.S. This objective was addressed using a national database of poeciliid introductions. Records were dominated by a handful of states and most introductions led to established populations. While translocated mosquitofish were found across many states and climates, non-natives were found almost exclusively in warm climate states and territories (e.g., Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico), especially where air temperatures remained above freezing. Outside warm climate states, 46% of established non-native populations were located at thermal spring sources. These results indicate that thermal springs extend the distribution of non-natives, but were relatively unimportant for translocated poeciliids.

It is important to recognize any contemporary hydrothermal contribution in paleoenvirommental reconstruction of lake basins because recharge from thermal waters can potentially confuse paleoclimatic signals preserved in the lacustrine sedimentary record. Hot spring deposits (travertine, sinter) provide the most tangible evidence for thermal recharge to lakes. Although subaerial spring deposits have been widely studied, lacustrine thermal spring deposits, especially sublacustrine siliceous sinters, remain poorly known. Detailed field, petrographic and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies have been made of fossil sublacusuine sinter exposed at Soro hot springs along the northeastern shoreline of O1 Kokwe, a volcanic island in Lake Baringo, Kenya, Modem hot springs at Soro, which discharge Na-HCO3-Cl waters from a deep reservoir ( similar to 180degreesC), have thin (1 - 10 mm), friable microbial silica crusts around their subaerial vents, but thicker ( >1 cm) sinter deposits are not forming. The fossil sinter, which is present as intergranular cements and crusts in littoral conglomerates and sandstones, is composed mainly of opaline silica (opal-A). Three types of fossil sinter are recognized: (1) massive structureless silica, A which fills intergranular pores and forms crusts up to 5 cm thick (2) pore-lining silica, some of which is isopachous, and (3) laminated silica crusts, which formed mainly on the upper surfaces of detrital particles, All three types contain well-preserved diatoms including lacustrine planktonic forms. Microbial remains, mainly filamentous and coccoid bacteria (including cyanobacteria) and extracellular polymeric gels, are locally abundant in the opaline silica, together with detrital clays and thin laminae composed of authigenic chlorite (?), Most of the hydrothermal silica precipitated when the thermal springs were submerged by fresh lake water, Silica precipitated upon rapid cooling of thermal ( similar to 90 degreesC) waters at and just below their interface with the overlying cooler ( similar to 25 degreesC) lake waters. Microbial mats locally acted as a filter that limited mixing and rapid dilution of the thermal fluids, Some of the silica originally may have been soft and partly gelatinous. Planktonic diatoms and detrital clay rained down, then became incorporated in the amorphous silica. Following a fall in lake level, the opal-A lithified and partly altered to cristobalite (opal-C) and chalcedony, The lowest fossil sinters were later encrusted by calcite stromatolites, A with calcite and quartz forming late pore-filling cements. The age of the sublacustrine sinters is unknown, but some of the deposits could date back to the late Pleistocene. Similar conglomerates cemented by hydrothermal silica are present along fault lines at neighbouring Lake Bogoria. Such rocks may provide evidence for deep, hot fluid recharge to lakes when encountered in the geological record. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Thermal spring emergences are located along the Tyrrhenian coast in two different areas: near Padule-S. Rocco (41 degrees 7.5'N 13 degrees 53.4'E) at the foot of Mt. Petrino, and near Levagnole (41 degrees 8.5'N 13 degrees 51.3'E) at the foot of Mt. Pizzuto. The water isotopic composition of both thermal discharges is lighter than the one of local shallow groundwater (delta O-18 congruent to -6.3 parts per thousand SMOW vs. congruent to -5.9 parts per thousand; delta D congruent to -40 parts per thousand SMOW vs. congruent to -36 parts per thousand, respectively) as a consequence of inland higher altitude of recharge by rainfall, suggesting that thermal water undergoes a deep and long flow-path before emerging along the coast. The chemical composition of the highest temperature samples of two areas points that fluids in the hydrothermal reservoir(s) interact with similar lithologies, since they are both hosted in the lower sedimentary carbonate formations of the Campanian-Latial Apennine succession. However, the two spring systems are different in terms of temperature and salinity (Levagnole: congruent to 50 degrees C and 8.9 g/L vs. Padule. congruent to 32 degrees C and 7.4 g/L, respectively). The higher salinity of Levagnole springs is due to a longer interaction with evaporite material embedded in Miocene sedimentary formations and to the eventual mixing, during rising, with fresh seawater close to the seashore. The chemical and isotopic composition of the free gases associated with the springs, again suggests a different source of the two hydrothermal systems. Comparing the He-3/He-4 measured ratios with other gas emissions located NE and SE of Mt. Massico-Roccamonfina alignment, it is evident that the Levagnole thermal springs are related to the northern Latial mantle wedge where the He-3/He-4 is about 0.5 R/Ra, whereas the Padule-S. Rocco springs, although being only 3.5 km south of Levagnole, are related to the Campanian mantle wedge where R/Ra is always >= 2.0. Such a difference in He-3/He-4 ratio in a very short distance, clearly, suggests a different source of the PaduleS. Rocco gas phase rising to the surface through the deep transpressive regional fault(s) system related to the NE-SW Ortona-Roccamonfina tectonic alignment.

In Brazil, the period 1930-1950 corresponded to the construction peak of thermal and non-thermal spas for therapeutic and leisure purposes. In 1944, the President Getulio Vargas inaugurated a large spa at Barreiro area in Araxa city. The DBS waters have low salinity, high radioactivity, discharge sustained by the recharging rainwater, and expected low residence time in the aquifer due to the maximum recharge-discharge distance of 2-3 km. The AJS waters are hypothermal/thermal, alkaline, sulfured, highly saline, exhibiting deep circulation and discharging in a site dominated by slightly weathered rocks. Barreiro area is also characterized by the exploration of phosphate fertilizer (begun in 1947-1948) and niobium (identified in pyrochlore in 1953). Since the 60s and 70s, the demand for these resources increased, favoring the release of contaminants into the environment. As a consequence, several professionals and institutions belonging to different sectors of the society have pointed out potential environmental problems due to possible contamination of the DBS and AJS waters, with implications for reducing the tourism activities in the region that take an important role on the municipality economy. This study compared the major hydrochemical characteristics of the DBS and AJS waters with those of other surface waters and rainwater occurring in that area for identifying possible degradation of their quality due to the anthropogenic inputs taking place there.

In wound healing, the role of microorganisms is no longer considered to be just counteracting, but also promoting. Furthermore, host-microbe interactions are essential for numerous aspects of normal mammalian physiology, from metabolic activity to immune homeostasis. Each area of the human body hosts a unique microbial community, and the composition of microbiota is dependent on the host, age and the anatomical area, and it changes according to the characteristics of the microenvironment. Every squared centimeter of skin contains similar to 1 billion bacteria. The majority of microorganisms of the skin are commensal or temporary passing members. Skin flora mechanisms interacting or influencing the human physical skin barrier are not well defined. Resident skin bacteria provide the first line of defence against potentially dangerous pathogens and produce small molecules that influence their microbial neighbours. Furthermore, the microbiota activates and assists innate immunity and influences adaptive immunity. Various types of immune and non-immune cells contribute to wound healing. The proliferative phase of wound healing is inversely proportional to the extent of the post-traumatic inflammatory reaction. Topical bacterial lipopolysaccharide application markedly affects wound healing by accelerating the resolution of inflammation, increasing macrophage infiltration, enhancing collagen synthesis and altering the secretion of mediators involved in skin regeneration. Various studies have investigated the biological contents of thermal spring waters, and their anti-inflammatory and immune protective roles. In addition, the regenerative properties of thermal spring waters were analysed in an experimental animal wound model. The areas treated with thermal water healed faster than the areas treated with conventional dressings, and exhibited a collagen and elastic fiber network comparable with the normal skin. Thus, the microbial environment may be considered as a potential tool in regenerative medicine and surgery.

Groundwater composition in perched-water bodies in the north flank of Fogo volcano (So Miguel, Azores): main causes and comparison with river water chemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Groundwater chemistry; Springs; Volcanic aquifers; Azores archipelago	SAO-MIGUEL; ISLAND AZORES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; GEOCHEMISTRY; PORTUGAL; SPRINGS; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; FLUXES; FRAMEWORK; DISCHARGE	A set of 46 springs located in the north flank of Fogo volcano (So Miguel, Azores) were sampled to characterize groundwater chemistry. The majority of the discharge from volcanic rocks with acidic character (95 %), at an elevation range of 200-400 m a.s.l., and the average discharge are usually not higher than 2 L/s. Nevertheless, the discharge in a few springs from trachytic lava flows can be higher (21.3 L/s). A group of 12 surface water samples were also collected twice along the Ribeira Grande River. Groundwater average temperature ranges between 19.6 and 20.7 A degrees C, and it is possible to depict two groups of discharges: thermal waters (16.7 %), with a temperature range from 27.8 to 71.2 A degrees C, and cold waters, with temperature under 20 A degrees C. In this latter group, temperature is inversely proportional to elevation. The average pH and conductivity range, respectively, between 5.7 and 7.8 and 291-425 mu S/cm. Nevertheless, higher conductivity values were measured in boiling pools. Groundwater mainly belongs to the Na-HCO3 to Na-Cl types. The major-ion relative composition of the cold springs shows a decreasing order for cations as Na > Ca > K > Mg and for anions HCO3 > Cl > SO4. In thermal discharges the relative composition is, respectively, Na > Ca > K > Mg and SO4 > HCO3 > Cl. The average nitrate content ranges from 2.09 to 2.57 mg/L comparing all the sampling periods, and the cumulative probability plot shows that about 75 % of the samples present values lower than 1.98 mg/L. Results show clearly that the higher nitrate measurements are observed in river waters and springs sampled in areas where pasture lands are dominant.	[Cabral, L.; Andrade, C.; Coutinho, R.; Cruz, J.

From the center outwards, the alteration zones in the hot spring of the Rehai consist of alunite and silica in a breccia zone, a kaolinite and illite zone, and a chlorite, illite, kaolinite zone. The gas phase in the hot spring is dominated by CO2 with delta C-13 ranging from 4.5 parts per thousand to 7.2 parts per thousand. These features indicate a major magmatic origin of the hot spring gas. The He-3/He-4 ratios in the gas from central Tengchong vary from 1.56 to 5.88, approaching to those of the MORB. This is probably related to the ongoing subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Tengchong block. The hot spring waters in the central Tengchong block have much higher content of Au and other elements, e.g., Ag, As, Sb, and Tl, than other typical hot springs, such as Hasbrouck, Suffer, etc. in the world. The hot springs with more mantle gas contribution and higher water temperature show more elevated Au contents, which implies that the metal in the hot spring was most likely contributed from the magmatic gas. The compiled D-O isotopes of the hot spring waters from previous studies suggest that they are primarily derived from meteoric water. A genetic model for the hot spring system in the central of Tengchong has been tentatively established. The gold-charged hot spring is genetically connected to an active magma chamber, which was produced by subduction of oceanic crust. The chamber is driving long-term surface meteoric circulation and constantly releasing magmatic volatiles enriched with metals. As hot spring water mixed with magmatic volatiles, causing decompression-boiling and forming hydraulic fractures to penetrate the roof of siliceous sinter, which induced the continuing metal deposition and formed the Lianghe hot spring.

Effects of abiotic factors on the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities in acidic thermal springs	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; HOT-SPRINGS; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; SP. NOV.; MICROORGANISMS; ENVIRONMENT; TEMPERATURE; HYDROGEN; LIFE	Acidic thermal springs offer ideal environments for studying processes underlying extremophile microbial diversity. We used a carefully designed comparative analysis of acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park to determine how abiotic factors (chemistry and temperature) shape acidophile microbial communities. Small-subunit rRNA gene sequences were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced, by using evolutionarily conserved bacterium-specific primers, directly from environmental DNA extracted from Amphitheater Springs and Roaring Mountain sediment samples. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and colorimetric assays were used to analyze sediment chemistry, while an optical emission spectrometer was used to evaluate water chemistry and electronic probes were used to measure the pH, temperature, and E-h of the spring waters. Phylogenetic-statistical analyses found exceptionally strong correlations between bacterial community composition and sediment mineral chemistry, followed by weaker but significant correlations with temperature gradients. For example, sulfur-rich sediment samples contained a high diversity of uncultured organisms related to Hydrogenobaculum spp., while iron-rich sediments were dominated by uncultured organisms related to a diverse array of gram-positive iron oxidizers. A detailed analysis of redox chemistry indicated that the available energy sources and electron acceptors were sufficient to support the metabolic potential of Hydrogenobaculum spp. and iron oxidizers, respectively. Principal-component analysis found that two factors explained 95% of the genetic diversity, with most of the variance attributable to mineral chemistry and a smaller fraction attributable to temperature.

Seedling emergence timing	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrothermal time; Seedling emergence timing; Seedling recruitment zone; Soil temperature; Soil water; Spring wheat	GERMINATION RESPONSE; HYDROTHERMAL TIME; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; PREDICTION; MOISTURE; TILLAGE; GROWTH	Predictions of seedling emergence timing for spring wheat are facilitated by process-based modeling of the microsite environment in the shallow seedling recruitment zone. Hourly temperature and water profiles within the recruitment zone for 75 days after planting were simulated from the process-based Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model using local and non-local microclimatic data. Linear mixed-effects models indicated that simulated thermal and hydrothermal time accumulations were similar to measurements. Emergence timing was fitted using the Gompertz equation. Simulations averaged across depth had quicker emergence timing of wheat at inflection by 20 degrees Cd for thermal time and 23 MPa degrees Cd for hydrothermal time models, equating to 1.3 days earlier in the DAP model. Seedling emergence rates were similar between simulations and measurements. Simulations for emergence timing with hydrothermal time improved upon thermal time only at the soil surface. The recruitment depth of spring wheat over time was fitted with a Beta function which was positively skewed with early recruitment of a large number of seedlings from a moderate depth and late recruitment by a small number of seedlings from a shallow depth. The time of simulated Beta maxima was greater by 39 degrees Cd for thermal time and 3 MPa degrees Cd for hydrothermal time, and 1.5 days less than the measured maxima for the DAP model. The 95% confidence intervals for the fitted simulation and measured Beta functions overlapped for the entire duration of the distribution for all time scale models. Process-based simulations of soil temperature and soil water in the seedling recruitment zone provided representative predictions of seedling emergence timing for spring wheat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The chemistry of more than 100 thermal and ground water samples collected between 1936 and 2005 indicate that the Na-Cl hot spring waters are a mixture of "andesitic" magmatic. sea and meteoric waters. Mixing models and silica and cation geothermometry were used to estimate the SiO(2) and Cl composition and the temperature (similar to 200 degrees C) of the reservoir fluids deep in the geothermal system. The isotopic data ((18)O and D) are consistent with a mixed origin interpretation of the waters feeding the Obama hot springs, i.e. a large proportion of meteoric and sea waters, and a small magmatic component. Temperatures and chemical concentrations of the thermal waters were affected by the 1944-1959 salt production operations, but have recovered after closure of the salt factories: now they are similar to their pre-1940 values. In the future, the Obama geothermal field may be suitable for electric power generation, although heat and fluid extraction will require careful management to prevent or minimize reservoir cooling.

The wheat crop water consumption in the research sites (Calarasi and Teleorman counties), for the entire vegetation period, autumn - spring - summer, is between 1000 and 1050 m(3) of water for each ton of wheat produced. Only in the spring-summer period, the wheat extracts a quantity of about 5960 m(3) ha(-1), i.e. 851 m(3) t(-1). The useful water reserve is normally located at about 1500 m(3)/ha(-1), at a soil depth of 0-150 cm. In the spring of 2020, it has been below 400 m3 ha(-1), so that at the beginning of May the soil moisture had almost reached the wilting coefficient (WC). Wheat plants have been able to survive the thermal and water shock of late spring -early summer, due to enhanced thermal alternation between air and soil. For a period of about 34 days, this alternation brought the plants 1-1.5 mm water, i.e. approximately 442 m(3) ha(-1), which allowed the prolongation of the plant's agony until the rains of the second half of May. Yields have been, depending on the variety, between 1500 and 3000 kg ha(-1), in average, covering only 60% of the crop costs. Other measures to save water in the soil have also been proposed in the paper.

During the Kedarnath Disaster in 2013, the thermal spring and most of the areas surrounding the Kedarnath temple lies ruined and covered by debris. In the present study, an effort has been made to image the debris covered source of the geothermal groundwater potential zones for rejuvenating the Gaurikund thermal spring and to understand the mechanism for enhancing the continuous recharge and flow of this hot spring. We have carried out hydrogeological measurements with these objectives at four locations (points 1-4). The obtained data indicates that spring water temperature varies from 35 to 58 degrees C and point-2 was observed to be the main source of the spring, situated adjacent to the Gauri Mata temple. Besides this, we performed 2D electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) profile with different configurations in the vicinity of the spring along the right bank of the Mandakini River. ERI reveals two distinct low resistivity horizons with resistivity variation from 20 to 50 Om within the depth of 5-15 m. The low resistivity zones have been interpreted to be the thermal spring's potential source, which occurs either along the fractured zones with channelized groundwater flow or along highly weathered zones. The study suggests that the source of the Gaurikund hot spring is located in the hanging-wall of the Vaikrita Thrust, a northerly dipping major structural unit and weak zone that can play a significant role in reviving the Gaurikund geothermal spring.

Thermal to mechanical energy conversion is produced by the Nitinol SMA spring shape memory effect. Assumed seawater temperature (70 degrees C) difference between hot ocean surface water and depth bottom cold water (100 m) causes the martensitic phase transformation. And this temperature is achieved using a solar water heater incorporated into the system floating at the seawater surface. Engine behavior is modeled and simulated. A comparison between experimental and simulated data is carried out, and it gives a good fitting between them. The methodology used is by developing the new conceptual design and theory of the engine, then followed by construction and testing of the engine. The experiment conducted involved the measurement of the output torque as well as the performance of the engine. The maximum driving force, rotational speed, moment, output power, and efficiency are measured and calculated as 21.4 N, 13rpm, 2.18 Nm, 1.7 watt, and 3.5%, respectively. The efficiency of the engine is also observed to be decreasing as speed increases. The mechanical power generated by the engine will be further converted to electrical power through the coupling of a DC generator on the engine output shaft on pulley 2.

Riffles exhibit complex thermal behaviour, hypothesized to be caused by local alteration of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, but hitherto most research has been in upland/gravel-bed/hard rock catchments. Accordingly, this article aims: (1) to characterize spatio-temporal variability in hyporheic temperature over two riffles (R1 and R2) in a lowland river basin (Tern, Shropshire, UK) underlain by sandstone, and (2) to explain thermal dynamics by inferring hyporheic processes and the influence of GW-SW interactions. Hyporheic (riffle head, crest and tail at 0.1. 0.2 and 0.4 m), water column, spring water and air temperature were collected at 15 min resolution over 22 months and used to explore seasonal variations. Borehole water levels and temperature provide insight into groundwater variability over a hydrological year. Hyporheic temperature is cooler (warmer) than water column in summer (winter), with convergence in spring and autumn. Riffle heads and R2 crest yield small thermal gradients. and RI tail larger vertical difference. RI crest temperature is similar and attenuated (cf. water column) at all depths. R2 tail temperature differs markedly from surface water. Thus, hyporheic temperature varies temporally across and between riffles, reflecting: (1) hydroclimatological controls on river and groundwater temperature, and (2) hydrological, local morphological and sedimentary controls on surface water and groundwater flux. This research demonstrates the utility of depth-related riverbed temperature time-series in understanding hyporheic zone processes and GW-SW interactions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Mineral deposition from saturated waters potentially entombs these organisms complicating hydrological control of the fossilization process. Near-surface and subsurface hydrology of these systems is governed by the porosity and continuity of pore spaces in microbial mats and associated sinter deposits. Herein we examine the evolution of pore space in microbial mats with emphasis on the relationship between pore size and geometry, and silica deposition. Microbial mats living in the outflow channels of silica-rich thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park, WY, and Steamboat Springs, NV are best preserved under conditions of intermittent inundation and drying and/or cooling. This leads to periodic deposition of silica initially as a coating on the cells and eventually as an infilling in the cells. As a consequence, pore spaces between microbial filaments retain characteristic configurations and are filled with silica crystals of different size and morphology than that of the coatings or fillings. The nature of the pore-filling silica is controlled by the temperature and chemistry of the water flowing through the sinter mound and is indicative of the environment of preservations.

A 3D CFD model interpreting this photovoltaic/thermal system is then developed and used to predict the temperature of the different components of this hybrid system. Numerical results of the water outlet temperature and PVT system thermal efficiency are compared to the experimental data and a good agreement is seen proving the validity of the developed CFD model. The temperature contours are also presented for different instants of the day, helping to understand the different phenomenon related to the photovoltaic/thermal conversion of the solar energy using this concentrating system.

Yet such measurements would provide important information that can be used to help evaluate the total thermal heat transport associated with the Yellowstone Caldera. Typically, discharge from thermal springs migrates through the shallow subsurface, making accurate measurement problematic. Here we present direct measurements of mass and thermal discharge from hot springs in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park, USA. We added small amounts of nearly pure D2O to four springs in the Morning Mist Springs area that ranged in temperature from 74 to 95 degrees C and analyzed time-series delta D samples to determine the volumes and discharge rates of the test springs. D2O was chosen to limit the ecological and/or visual impacts of other common tracers, such as NaCI or fluorescein dyes. We calculated spring volumes to range between 560 and 27,400 L and estimated mass and heat discharge as 0.08-1.25 L/s and 0.0189-0.312 MW, respectively. The volumes calculated by deuterium doping were larger in every case than those estimated by field inspection, suggesting that the volume participating in shallow fluid circulation is generally larger than is apparent from the surface. The heat flow data, when paired with conductive heat loss estimates in the vicinity of the springs, suggest that current estimates of thermal discharge at Yellowstone may underestimate heat loss from the caldera and offer insights on the rate of magma supplied by the mantle. Thermal flux estimates suggest that a minimum of 3.2-6.3 km(3) x 10(-2) of basalt magma enters the base of the crust annually.

Organic compounds in thermal water: The Mutnovskii area and the Uzon caldera	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY			English	Article							KAMCHATKA; ORIGIN; LIFE; OIL	New data are reported relating to the presence and relative concentrations of organic compounds of medium volatility in samples from the water of hot springs and in the condensate of a steam-water mixture from wells drilled in the Mutnovskii geothermal area and from a well and springs in the Uzon caldera. The Mutnovskii area was found to contain 95 compounds belonging to 16 homologous series, with 71 compounds (12 series) in the Uzon caldera. Among these we found homologous series of biologically important compounds: carbonic acids, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, and others. Evidence was obtained for a contribution of the abiogenic component in organic matter from sterile condensates of an overheated steam-water mixture from wells (alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, and others) and in thermal water from natural discharges (in particular, alkanes and chlorine-containing hydrocarbons). The results of this study can be used for the preparation and conduction of laboratory experiments in prebiological chemistry under conditions that simulate a hydrothermal environment.

It comes from a reservoir having an estimated temperature of 225-235 degrees C, although temperatures somewhat higher than 260 degrees C may be present at the roots of the system. The geothermal reservoir at Chachimbiro is recharged mainly by meteoric water (about 92%) and secondarily by are-type magmatic water. Carbon and sulfur isotope data support a magmatic origin for the C and S species entering the geothermal system from below, consistent with indications provided by He isotopes. The thermal springs of Na-Cl to Na-Cl-HCO3 type located in the Chachimbiro area originate through dilution of the parent geothermal water and have reached different degrees of re-equilibration with country rocks at lower temperatures.

The latter gains its mineralization while crossing the Triassic evaporites mainly through a deep loop in the Apanic?? syncline. The fast upflow of this deep water occurs at the cross of large active lines (the North-Pyrenean thrust located at depth, and the Saison transverse fault). Cave diving in the nearby Maddalen Cave allowed reaching the phreatic passage at the origin of the cold spring, which however also crosses the thermal body in the third sump (S3). Both water bodies are separated by a sharp thermocline. Six pressure-temperature dataloggers were placed in both water bodies along the thermocline for six months. The dataloggers located downstream on either side of the thermocline show at the beginning of flood first a rise of the thermal body, then an invasion of the whole phreatic passage by the cold floodwater, controlled by head pressure changes in the karst aquifer. From observation of these mechanisms, we deduce a hydrodynamic model with a warm plume rising into the cold aquifer, without significant mixing. Such independence of water bodies is explained by the decrease of turbulent rate at the interface, due to the sharp density gradient. The relative absence of mixing does not actually require independent ???watertight??? routes, both water bodies can thus coexist even in the same conduit. This model locally implies the existence of unknown secondary passages close to the spring, which allow an independent draining of each water body toward separate outlets during low stage. Such type of stratified aquifer linked to density differences is common in of the Harz in Germany, Kungur karst in Ural, etc.), but remains poorly identified in continental carbonate karst areas, mainly because of the difficulty of access. Together with the Mescla Spring in French Alpes-Maritimes, the Camou twin springs discharging in the same porch are an outstanding example, allowing a direct study of the stratification and the dynamic of highly contrasted water bodies.

Recharge water flows through Basin and Range extension fractures where it is heated by the geothermal gradient and ultimately discharges from the damage zone of the trans-Challis faults located near the bottom of the MFBR. Stable isotopes of water, C-14 groundwater ages, fracture and fault orientations, fracture volume changes due to chemical evolution, and recharge area calculations suggest that the thermal springs issue from individual hydrothermal systems and that they are self-organizing. Water evolves chemically along flow paths, dissolving feldspars and precipitating secondary minerals. Secondary minerals accumulate in less-efficient fractures and are flushed from the more efficient ones. Flow-area calculations using heat-flow, exponential decay-of-porosity, and curve-intersection methods show that many of the thermal systems extend beyond their immediate topographic watershed, and that some capture water from adjacent watersheds. Geochemical/flow feedback loops that provide a mechanism for self-organization are modeled using PHREEQC, and positive and negative fracture volume changes are calculated. Criteria for identifying self-organizing granitoid thermal groundwater systems are suggested.

J	Bonny, S; Jones, B				Bonny, S; Jones, B			Relict tufa at Miette Hot Springs, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article							KENYA RIFT-VALLEY; NEW-ZEALAND; NORTH-ISLAND; THERMAL SPRINGS; CALCITE PRECIPITATION; LAKE BOGORIA; TRAVERTINE; DEPOSITS; STROMATOLITES; RECORD	At the Miette Hot Springs site, relict tufa stretches for nearly 500 m along the west side of Sulphur Creek valley and rises up to 30 m above the valley floor. The tufa, composed of low-Mg calcite, precipitated from waters discharged from a line of perched springs. C-14 dating of bone material embedded in the tufa indicates that tufa precipitation took place between similar to4500 and 2500 years BP under cool and moist climatic conditions. The spring biota was dominated by filamentous microbes (mainly Phormidium and Oscillatoria), with fewer diatoms (including Cymbella), testate protozoans (including Quadrulella), ostracodes (including Darwinula, Heterocypris, Cadonia, and Cyclocypris), and various bryophytes. The ecological preferences of these microbes indicate that the spring water had near-neutral pH, was Ca, HCO3, and H2S-SO4 rich, and emerged at 50-65degreesC. Landslides disrupted the west wall of Sulphur Creek valley during and after tufa growth. The relict tufa is divided into six morphotypes that reflect variations in water flow down the steep and rugged flow path. Domal tufa is located around the spring vents, roll-over tufa developed where water flowed over sharp lips or structural barricades, vertical tufa formed where calcite was precipitate from water flowing down steep to vertical inclines, flat-banded tufa reflects precipitation on a gentle slope, and wedge-shaped tufa formed where more rapid downslope calcite precipitation caused a progressive decrease in slope. The tufa contains stromatolitic facies (including streamer, porous laminar, dense laminar) and nonstromatolitic facies (bedded, crenulated) that reflect variations in the biology, water temperature, and style of flow of different parts of the spring flow path.

It is now necessary to clarify the relationship between tectonic movements, earthquakes and the evolution of hot springs. In this paper, laboratory analyses of major, trace elements, delta D, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 values of 28 hot spring waters in the Jinshajiang fault zone (JSJFZ) in the northwestern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block were conducted. The results showed that the primary source of water for JSJFZ hot springs was atmospheric precipitation. The geothermal reservoir temperature variation based on the silicon enthalpy mixing model ranged from 73 to 272?. And the circulation depth range was 1.2-5.4 km. The segmentation characteristics of the Sr-87/Sr-86 values were related to the influence of source rocks on groundwater cycle processes. A conceptual model of the hydrologic cycle of hot springs explained the spatial distribution of earthquakes associated with tectonic movements. The Batang segment had the strongest water-rock reaction, the highest reservoir temperature and the deepest circulation depth; meanwhile, it was also an earthquake prone area. The fluid circulation of the JSJFZ corresponds well with the seismicity, which indicates that the hydrological characteristics of the hot spring water in a fracture zone play a crucial role in receiving information on seismic activity.

Their biological activities directly depend on the ionic composition of the spring. However, in order to exhibit beneficial properties, the minerals need to reach viable skin layers. The present study addresses the incorporation of marketed TSW in model cosmetic formulations and the impact of the formulation on skin absorption of magnesium and calcium ions that are known to improve skin barrier function. Methods Marketed TSW was introduced into five formulations. Liposomes were prepared using saturated or unsaturated phospholipids mixed with cholesterol by the thin layer evaporation technique. Emulsions water-in-oil (W/O), oil-in-water (O/W) or double: water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) were prepared by high-shear mixing. Skin absorption of Mg2+ and Ca2+ from those formulations was studied in vitro using static Franz diffusion cells under infinite dose condition and under occlusion of the apparatus. Results Mg2+ and Ca2+ penetrate skin samples from TSW. Encapsulating TSW into double emulsion (TSW/O/W) increased skin absorption of both cations of interest and kept the Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio equal to that of TSW in each skin layer. The dermal absorption of Mg2+ from the double emulsion departs from both single emulsions. Application of liposome suspension improved the skin absorption of Ca2+ while keeping constant that of Mg2+, leading to unbalanced Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio inside skin. Conclusion The beneficial effects of TSW are not only due to their action on the skin surface. Their active components, especially Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations, reach viable skin layers in a formulation-dependent manner. The distribution of ions inside skin depends on the type of formulation.

Inferring air- water temperature relationships from river and catchment properties	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						climate change; water temperature; riparian shade; logistic regression; springs	STREAM TEMPERATURE; THERMAL REFUGIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT; SALMON; FOREST; TROUT; MICROCLIMATE; POPULATIONS; PERSPECTIVE	Water temperature (Tw) is a key determinant of freshwater ecosystem status and cause for concern under a changing climate. Hence, there is growing interest in the feasibility of moderating rising Tw through management of riparian shade. The Loughborough University Temperature Network (LUTEN) is an array of 36 water and air temperature (Ta) monitoring sites in the English Peak District set-up to explore the predictability of local Tw, given Ta, river reach, and catchment properties. Year 1 of monitoring shows that 84%-94% of variance in daily Tw is explained by Ta. However, site-specific logistic regression parameters exhibit marked variation and dependency on upstream riparian shade. Perennial spring flows in the lower River Dove also affect regression model parameters and strongly buffer daily and seasonal mean Tw. The asymptote of the models (i.e. maximum expected Tw) is particularly sensitive to groundwater inputs. We conclude that reaches with spring flows potentially offer important thermal refuges for aquatic organisms against expected long-term warming of rivers and should be afforded special protection.

The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of the diatom microflora and ecology of the Casteldoria spring (northern Sardinia), in the hottest geothermal district of the Island. A total of 132 diatom taxa (56 genera) were found from three investigated substrates: rock (near the water emergence point), cobbles and sediments (in the spring-fed rivulet). Overall, 62 taxa (47% of the total) were common to other thermal springs of the Mediterranean area. Significant differences in the species composition among all substrates were highlighted by the ANOSIM test (global R = 0.554; p = 0.1%). The assemblages from rock formed a separated cluster from assemblages from cobbles and sediments in the nMDS plot. Rock-dwelling assemblages also had a lower species richness, probably due to the higher water temperature. Total suspended solids, discharge, water temperature and bromine were the most correlated environmental variables with diatom species and seem to influence both species composition and structure of assemblages. Some abundant taxa, such as Pinnularia joculata and Rhopalodia operculata, which fit well on high temperature and mineral content, can be considered representative taxa of the studied spring. This study underlines the importance of investigating different substrates to document diatom biodiversity in a more exhaustive way. It contributes to the knowledge of diatoms and ecology in thermo-mineral springs of Sardinia, providing first information on species composition at small-spatial and seasonal scale.

J	Malm, J				Malm, J			Spring circulation associated with the thermal bar in large temperate lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article								The overall circulation pattern in spring is rather specific as density-induced currents may be of significance. The density-driven circulation perpendicular to the shore can be described as consisting of two circulation cells, with a zone of convergence, referred to as thermal bar, in between. The thermal bar, which coincides with the 4 degrees C isotherm (the temperature of maximum density), inhibits horizontal water exchange, implying its practical importance. In this paper, a hydrodynamic numerical model is used to study the relative influence of wind- and density-driven currents in a large temperate lake during spring. The study shows that the general density-driven circulation is strongly dependent on the bottom topography, with a more pronounced circulation and considerable descending motions in the thermal bar zone in lakes with steep sloping bottoms. In shallow lakes, the wind-driven circulation dominates, and the effect of density-induced currents is marginal, except at locations with a drastic change in bottom depth.

For this purpose, a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes, vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The periodicity analysis were conducted with the Morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering a period of 5 years. The principal components analysis (PCA) has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability. The results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs. Wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns. The lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters. Temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations. Streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low, medium and high frequency behaviour. The PCA analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions, catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88.97% of the total variability in the data. The results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long-term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series. The study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature, and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters.

J	Larsen, D; Swihart, GH; Xiao, YK				Larsen, D; Swihart, GH; Xiao, YK			Hydrochemistry and isotope composition of springs in the Tecopa basin, southeastern California, USA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						stable isotopes; boron isotopes; hydrochemistry; hydrogeology; springs; California; Tecopa basin	SOUTHERN NEVADA GROUNDWATER; STABLE-ISOTOPES; DEATH-VALLEY; BORON; WATER; GEOCHEMISTRY; HYDROLOGY; FLOW	Springs and seeps in the Tecopa basin were sampled and analyzed for their major ion chemistry and oxygen, hydrogen, and boron isotope compositions in order to assess the possible origins of the waters. The Tecopa basin is a groundwater discharge area along the Amargosa River drainage basin south of the Nevada Test Site and proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. The spring waters are categorized into three end-member hydrochemical facies: (1) pH-neutral, Na + Ca + Mg + SO4 + HCO3 water with moderate to high total-dissolved solids;, (2) mildly alkaline, Na + Cl + SO4 + HCO3 water with high total dissolved solids; and (3) alkaline, Na + HCO3 + CO3 water with high total dissolved solids. The temperatures of most of the springs range from 17 degreesC to 32 degreesC; however, waters in the Tecopa Hot Spring area range from 9 degreesC to 47 degreesC. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions (normalized to SMOW) of the waters are as follows. The facies 1 springs have a mean delta O-18 of - 12.77 +/- 0.14%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 94.9 +/- 0.5%(o) (1 sigma). The facies 2 springs have a mean delta O-18 of - 12.73 +/- 0.19%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 97.7 +/- 0.9%o (1 sigma). The facies 3 spring has a mean delta O-18 of - 13.09 +/- 0.17%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 103.5 +/- 0.7%o (1 sigma). The mean boron concentrations and isotope compositions range from 2.4 mg/l and delta (11) B of + 2.5%o for facies I springs to 72.8 mg/l and delta (11) B of - 3.8%o for the facies 3 spring. The facies I waters have chemical and isotope compositions consistent with meteoric recharge in the Spring Mountains, NV, groundwater flow through the regional carbonate aquifer, and minor mixing with more concentrated water. The thermal, facies 2 waters are isotopically and chemically distinct from waters in the regional basin-fill and carbonate aquifer systems. These waters are interpreted to originate from fractured water-bearing strata beneath the regional carbonate aquifer that discharge only in the southernmost part of the Great Basin. The facies 3 spring is isotopically and chemically similar to basin-fill aquifer waters in the Amargosa Desert, but has higher sodium, alkalinity, and boron contents due to interaction with saline, alkaline-lake deposits of the Plio-Pleistocene Lake Tecopa beds. Geologic, geochemical, and isotope data suggest that these three distinct water types flow through hydrogeologic compartments in the Tecopa basin. The compartments are interpreted to have been created by the impermeable Lake Tecopa beds and geologic structures within the basin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Two spring turbulators having pitch 5 mm and 10 mm with a common wire diameter of 1 mm are being used. The experiment was carried out under turbulent flow at different Reynolds numbers varying between 4000 to 16,000. In this experiment, the variation in the rate of heat transfer and friction factor have been analyzed for parallel and counter flow arrangements. The combination of the lower-pitched insert with CuO attained the maximum heat transfer increment in the counter flow pattern. For counter flow arrangement, augmentation in Nusselt number for a triple tube with lower spring pitch with CuO nanofluid is 63.33%, which is higher in comparison to the plain triple tube with water as working fluid. The maximum thermal performance value is observed for plain tube with CuO nanofluid having the value 1.04 at Reynolds number of 4000.

These latter consist of thermal springs, travertine deposits and some hydrothermal alteration zones. The chemistry of twenty-one hot spring water samples highlight the heterogeneity of the water mineralization process in NW Algeria. Four major types of water are described. Na+-Cl- and Na+-SO42- with a high salinity up to 3794 mg/L accompanied by higher concentrations of F-, B-, Li+, Br- and Cs. These are probably derived from halite and gypsum rich evaporites from the surrounding environment. The other two types are Ca2+-HCO3- and Na+-HCO3-. Chloride rich waters are associated with local carbonate formations. The stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) reveal a fossil system since a large depletion of both isotopes from present-time meteoric waters cannot only be plausibly explained in terms of "inland" and "altitude" effects, we may suppose their recharge under climatic conditions much colder than the present ones taking place probably during the glacial period. The gas mixing models of N-2-He*1000-Ar*100 with O-2-CO2-He*1000 demonstrate an unarguable meteoric origin for the thermal waters, displaying air-saturated water (ASW) signatures. The collected thermal waters are 'immature' while the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures were estimated to be about at 133 degrees C. The updated geochemical conceptual model indicates two main processes in the flow path of the fossil meteoric water. 1) In the Bouhdjar geothermal zone, the infiltrated meteoric waters are conductively heated at depth because of the high heat flow (similar to 120 mW/m(2)), during their ascent, along hydrothermal conduits and towards the ground surface, they have possibly been influenced by heat advection from the underlying magma chambers and/or a percolation with intrusive bodies beneath spring vents. 2) The meteoric waters are recharged from high altitude areas of the Atlasic lands and are deeply circulated and heated at greater depths, hot waters probably mix with cooler Mg-rich waters and/or leach Mg2+ from the surrounding rocks when rising to the surface. Since the locations of the hot springs are close to populated areas, a direct use of this resource is feasible to supply some energy demands that include electricity generation using binary cycles or direct uses of heat.

Amiata silicic complex and surrounding areas (central Italy)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Review						geochemistry; water; gas; stable isotope; geothermics; Mt. Amiata; Central Italy	LARDERELLO GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; THERMAL SPRINGS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; NEW-ZEALAND; TUSCANY; EVOLUTION; EQUILIBRIA; MANTLE; HELIUM	The Mt. Amiata volcano in central Italy is intimately related to the post-orogenic magmatic activity which started in Pliocene times. Major, trace elements, and isotopic composition of thermal and cold spring waters and gas manifestations indicate the occurrence of three main reservoir of the thermal and cold waters in the Mt. Amiata region. The deepest one is located in an extensive carbonate reservoir buried by thick sequences of low-permeability allochthonous and neo-autochthonous formations. Thermal spring waters discharging from this aquifer have a neutral Ca-SO4 composition due to the presence of anhydrite layers at the base of the carbonate series and, possibly, to absorption of deep-derived H2S with subsequent oxidation to SO42- in a system where pH is buffered by the calcite-anhydrite pair (Marini and Chiodini, 1994). Isotopic signature of these springs and N-2-rich composition of associated gas phases suggest a clear local meteoric origin of the feeding waters, and atmospheric O-2 may be responsible for the oxidation of H2S. The two shallower aquifers have different chemical features, One is Ca-HCO3 in composition and located in several sedimentary formations above the Mesozoic carbonates. The other one has a Na-Cl composition and is hosted in marine sediments filling many post-orogenic NW-SE-trending basins. Strontium, Ba, F, and Br contents have been used to group waters associated with each aquifer, Although circulating to some extent in the same carbonate reservoir, the deep geothermal fluids at Latera and Mt. Amiata and thermal springs discharging from their outcropping areas have different composition: Na-Cl and Ca-SO4 type, respectively, Considering the high permeability of the reservoir rock, the meteoric origin of thermal springs and the two different composition of the thermal waters, self-sealed barriers must be present at the boundaries of the geothermal systems. The complex hydrology of the reservoir rocks greatly affects the reliability of geothermometers in liquid phase, which understimate the real temperatures of the discovered geothermal fields. More reliable temperatures are envisaged by using gas composition-based geothermometers. Bulk composition of the 67 gas samples studied seems to be the result of a continuous mixing between a N-2-rich component of meteoric origin related to the Ca-SO4 aquifer and a deep CO2-rich component rising largely along the boundaries of the geothermal systems. Nitrogen-rich gas samples have nearly atmospheric N-2/Ar (= 83) and N-15/N-14 (delta = 0 parts per thousand) ratios whereas CO2-rich samples show anomalously high delta(15)N values (up to +6.13 parts per thousand), likely related to N-2 from metamorphic schists lying below the carbonate formations. On the basis of average C-13/C-12 isotopic ratio (delta(13)C around 0 parts per thousand), CO2 seems to originate mainly from thermometamorphic reactions in the carbonate reservoir and/or in carbonate layers embedded in the underlying metamorphic basement. Distribution of He-3/He-4 isotopic ratios indicates a radiogenic origin of helium in a tectonic environment that, in spite of the presence of many post-orogenic basins and mantle-derived magmatics, can presently be considered in a compressive phase.

Study focus: We investigated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), an important vector for many chemical elements that may impact the quality of the coastal environment. First, we acquired airborne thermal infrared (TIR) images to detect terrestrial groundwater inputs. Then we report in situ data (salinity; temperature; radium isotopes). We use these data i) to confirm the presence of groundwater discharge and to characterize the different systems, and ii) to quantify SGD fluxes and estimate the residence time of the water bodies. New hydrological insights for the region: Few studies have been conducted on SGD along the French Mediterranean coastline. The terrestrial groundwater spring inputs in La Palme and SalsesLeucate coastal lagoons are in the range (0.04-0.11) m(3) s(-1), <= 2% of the local river inputs. In comparison, total SGD estimates to La Palme lagoon (0.56-1.7 m(3) s(-1)) suggest that the recirculation of lagoon water through the sediment is two orders of magnitude greater than the terrestrial groundwater inputs. At the Calanque of Port-Miou, the terrestrial groundwater flux to the coastal seas was between 0.6 and 1.2 m(3) s(-1) in July 2009. This study demonstrates the application of airborne TIR remote sensing for detecting surficial groundwater springs, and the inability of the method to detect deeper, submerged springs.

The temperatures of spring waters range from 35 to 81A degrees C and are mainly of HCO3-Na center dot Ca type. The total discharge of the hot spring is about 10 L/s. The spring is characterized by its huge travertine terrace with an area of about 4,000 m(2) and as many as 18 travertine cones of different sizes. The tallest travertine cone is as high as 7.1 m. The travertine formation and evolution can be divided into three periods: travertine terrace deposition period, travertine cone formation period and death period. The hydrochemical characteristics of the Jifei hot spring was analyzed and compared with a local non-travertine hot spring and six other famous travertine springs. The results indicate that the necessary hydrochemical conditions of travertine and travertine cones deposition in the Jifei area are (1) high concentration of HCO3 (-) and CO2; (2) about 52.9% deep source CO2 with significantly high value; (3) very high milliequivalent percentage of HCO3 (-) (97.4%) with not very high milliequivalent percentage of Ca2+ (24.4%); and (4) a large saturation index of calcite and aragonite of the hot water.

FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						response time; ecosystem dynamics; inertia; resilience; species turnover; vegetation dynamics	SPECIES RICHNESS; BASE-RICHNESS; VEGETATION; GRADIENTS; CHEMISTRY; BIODIVERSITY; TERMINOLOGY; COMMUNITIES; PERSISTENCE; ECOSYSTEMS	Springs are characterized by consistent thermal and hydrologic conditions, which enable use of spring-inhabiting organisms as sensitive indicators of biogeochemical changes in their catchments. We hypothesized that bryophytes would show a stronger response than vascular plants to changes in spring water quality because submerged bryophytes do not take up compounds from the soil. We analyzed species responses to interannual changes in spring water quality (discharge, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and pH) in 57 forest springs over 4 consecutive years. We calculated interannual turnover in species composition for bryophytes and vascular plants with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. We applied regression analysis to test interannual changes in species composition of the taxonomic groups over time, and we used 2-sided t-tests to compare year-to-year changes in species composition between bryophytes and vascular plants. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to quantify the relative importance of different physicochemical variables and Pearson linear correlation to quantify short-term changes in vegetation relative to changes in spring-water pH. For both groups, interannual changes in species composition were significantly positively related to time scale. Bryophytes did not show a significantly stronger response than vascular plants to interannual changes in the environment. Alterations in pH and conductivity explained most of the observed interannual changes in species composition of both groups, whereas changes in water temperature and discharge were less important. However, responses of single species to environmental change may be delayed, resulting in inertia at the community and ecosystem scales. Hence, longer time periods need to be considered for a better understanding of response times of the vegetation of European forest springs to changes in spring water quality.

Geochemistry of thermal waters along fault segments in the Beas and Parvati valleys (north-west Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh) and in the Sohna town (Haryana), India	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						thermal waters; Himachal Pradesh; carbon isotopes; salinity; dissolved gases	DISSOLVED-GASES; RADON; EVOLUTION; SPRINGS; ORIGIN; FLUIDS; GROUNDWATER; EQUILIBRIA; DISCHARGES; GENERATION	A geochemical survey on thermal waters discharging in the Beas and Parvati valleys (Kulu District, Himachal Pradesh) and in the Sohna town (Gurgaon District, Haryana) was carried out in March 2002. The Beas and Parvati area is characterized by regional seismogenetic fault segments, thrusts and complex folded structures where deep fluid circulation occurs. Thermal springs have temperatures varying between 35 C and 89 C. The wide range of surface temperatures and water chemistries suggest the mixing, at various degrees, between a deep saline end-member and a shallow freshwater. Based on the high salinity and the enrichment in halogens (Cl, Br), B and Li, the contribution of the deeper end-member seems to be larger for Kulu and Kalath relative to Manikaran and Kasol. Moreover, a large input of crustal volatiles (He, CO2, H-2) is observed for Kulu and Kalath waters. The high dissolved CO2 content and its carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13(TDIC) = -2.87 and -7.49 parts per thousand vs. PDB for Kulu and Kalath, respectively) point to a deep, prevalent thermo-metamorphic provenance of the carbon dioxide. A general shallow (i.e., organic) origin of carbon dioxide is suggested for Kasol and Manikaran. The estimated deep temperatures based on the quartz geothermometer provide values ranging between 93-114 degrees C for all the thermal waters of the Beas and Parvati valleys. The Sohna thermal spring emerges at 42 C from joints of the seismogenetic Sohna fault. A Na-Cl-HCO3 composition characterizes this water with very low contents of all the selected minor and trace elements. High dissolved helium content points to a prolonged deep circulation, whereas calculated delta C-13-CO2 (-14.23 parts per thousand vs. PDB) is indicative of the general shallow origin of carbon dioxide. The estimated deep temperatures are close to the discharge ones, not providing any valuable information about the temperature of the deeper reservoir.

The CO2 flux from hydrothermal systems of the Karymsky volcanic Centre, Kamchatka	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union			THERMAL WATERS; LAKE; CALDERA; SOIL; EVOLUTION; GASES	The CO2 flux provided by the hydrothermal activity within the Karymsky Volcanic Centre, Kamchatka, was measured, and the CO2 balance of the Karymsky caldera lake was estimated in the framework of a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) project. The Karymsky Volcanic Centre located in the SE of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the middle of the modern volcanic front consists of two calderas, hosts a caldera lake and is characterized by hydro thermal activity that is manifested at several thermal fields. Within the Akademii Nauk (AN) caldera which is filled by a caldera lake, the Akademii Nauk springs discharge boiling water into the lake. The lake is drained by the Karymsky River that then crosses the caldera of the Karymsky volcano (Karymsky caldera) and drains the thermal field of CO2-rich Karymsky springs. The lake after the 1996 sublimnic eruption is in a steady-state condition with the total dynamic CO2 budget of about 4 t/day, and has a total amount of CO2 stored inside of the lake of around 8000 t. The thermal springs of the Karymsky caldera drained by the Karymsky River enrich the river in dissolved carbon species. A total CO2 output of 320 t/day from both Karymsky Centre calderas was estimated, carrying around 130 t/day carbon species (expressed as CO2) as dissolved species (HCO3 and CO2(aq)), and emitting to the atmosphere around 190 t/day of CO2 as the diffusion flux from the soil and bubbling emanations from the springs.

Rivers have delta(11)B values around 40 parts per thousand and B concentrations lower than 30 mu g/L, while thermal springs have delta(11)B of 8-15 parts per thousand and B concentrations of 250-1000 mu g/L. River samples strongly impacted by hydrothermal inputs have intermediate delta(11)B and B contents. None of these surface water samples have delta(11)B comparable to the local unweathered volcanic rocks (around 0 parts per thousand), implying that a huge isotopic fractionation of 40 parts per thousand takes place during rock weathering, which could be explained by preferential incorporation of (10)B during secondary mineral formation and adsorption on clays, during rock weathering or in the soils. The soil-vegetation B cycle could also be a cause for such a fractionation. Atmospheric B with delta(11)B of 45 parts per thousand represents 25-95% of the river B content. The variety of the thermal spring chemical composition renders the understanding of B behavior in Guadeloupe hydrothermal system quite difficult. Complementary geochemical tracers would be helpful.

In the mainland, this thermal well is the nearest monitoring station to Taiwan. Precursory fluctuations in radon and chloride concentrations were observed before the earthquake with those in the period between April and September, 1999, possibly being the mid-term precursory anomaly of the Chi-Chi earthquake. The short-term radon anomaly that correlates with the main seismic event was well observed in the monitoring well. We suggest that radon anomalies in groundwater complemented with other hydrochemical parameters could be used more accurately as a preceding indication or even as a prediction of seismic events, if observed under suitable geological conditions.

Tertiary geodynamics and radiogenic heating from the Variscan batholith are the possible concurrent causes. Major anomalies were thought confined to the Tertiary basins, where 180 mW/m(2) are reported. New data ascertain that the occurrence of the hottest thermal springs does not mirror these basins, as they pour out from Variscan granites. Hence the high thermal flow from the basins can result from basin-wide heat redistribution by hot "granite" water flowing laterally in shallow aquifers. This scenario is particularly favourable for low-medium enthalpy fluids exploitation as well as for geoexchange. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the analysis, the use was made of monthly air temperatures recorded at fifteen meteorological stations, water temperatures of twelve lakes, and Hurrell's winter NAO indices. Over the study period (1971-2010), there was a marked increase in the temperatures of both, air and lake waters. Depending on the NAO phase, water temperatures were observed to depart from mean values, being markedly higher than average (even by 1 degrees C) in the positive winter NAO phase. The differences in water temperatures were statistically significant in the winter-spring season. In turn, in the negative NAO(DJFM) phase lake water temperatures in winter and spring were markedly lower than average (in March even by 1.0 degrees C). The unique response of some lakes depends on their morphometric parameters, including their mean depth.

It is interbedded with fluvial, lacustrine and volcaniclastic sediments, some silicified by infusing thermal waters. The exposed sinter (similar to4 m thick, 90 m long) was truncated at its southern margin by a landslide, which deposited a conglomerate (up to 2 m thick, 56 m long) of sinter blocks and associated strata nearby. Kaolinite-rich cobbles at the base of the conglomerate indicate a change in the thermal regime and its probable trigger: acid steam-condensate produced alteration. Clasts in the landslide are oriented SW, the same direction as flattened plant reeds entombed in sinter, and as intercalated fluvial beds. Thus, thermal waters, stream flow and the landslide all likely followed the same palaeo-valley, which is similar in terrain and stratigraphy to the Devonian Rhynie hydrothermal system. The plant-rich, layered, in situ sinter contains fossilised microbes and rare stromatolites. and was deposited on mid- to distal slopes adjacent to marshes. Ash falls, fluvial activity and ponding occurred during and after the thermal activity. Unsilicified tephric Ohakea loess (similar to26-17 kyr BP) and Taupo Tephra (1.86 kyr BP) blanket both sinter and landslide. Today, the deposits form resistant remnants in a topographically inverted landscape.

J	Spalj, DK				Spalj, Dora Kusan			Aquae Iasae - new discoveries in the Roman sanctuary - with special regard to the cults of Apollo, Aesculapius and Serapis	VJESNIK ARHEOLOSKOG MUZEJA U ZAGREBU			English	Article						Varazdinske Toplice; thermal sulphur water; spring reservoir; Apollo; Aesculapius; Serapis; oracle		The paper presents the results of the new archaeological excavations in Varazdinske Toplice, conducted from 2011 to 2015 in the area of the Roman sanctuary built around the natural hot spring. The excavations have shown that a wide area around the spring was enclosed during the 1st century AD, while a rectangular structure was built around it in the 2nd century AD; a spring reservoir 8 x 13.5 meters in size, from which thermal water was then lead to the baths through a system of canals. It was discovered that the spring reservoir was repaired in the 4th century AD using older inscriptions, reliefs, and even sculptures, which were used as regular construction material for masonry and backfill. More than 50 sacrificial altars, inscriptions, and reliefs were found, while the spring itself contained 17,000 Roman coins. Special attention is given in the paper to the finds that confirm the existence of cults dedicated to Apollo (Apollo/Sol), Aesculapius, and Serapis at the baths during the 2nd and 3rd century AD, which also testify to the popularity of this sanctuary among the highest government officials of the time. New finds also indicate the possibility of an oracle around the spring, and a relief with an inscription could allow us to infer the exact date of the festivities held in honour of female deities: Isis/Fortuna, Venus, and the nymphs.

Integrated study of surface and subsurface data for prospecting hydrogeothermal basins: case of the Maknassy basin (central Tunisia)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			French	Article						hydrogeothermal system; thermal spring; geothermal gradient; geothermometry; central Tunisia		To assess the hydrogeothermal resources of the Haddage region, Tunisia, a multi-disciplinary hydrogeothermal study comprising geological, geophysical, hydrochemical, geothermometric and hydro-geological approaches was undertaken in the Maknassy basin. This approach is important for the determination of the different chemical facies of thermal waters, and to relate them to their reservoirs of origin. It provides a good tool for the delimitation of hydrothermal basins. In fact, the integrated processing of all the existing and newly acquired data confirms that the thermal water of the Haddage region is of meteoric origin. It is deeply infiltrated within the Lower Cretaceous sands and sandstones (Boudinar Formation) and reaches high temperatures (60 degrees C) before emerging at the thermal spring in the discharge area as a result of tectonic disharmonies. In addition, a conceptual model of the hydrogeothermic behaviour of the Maknassy aquifer system has been developed.	[Bouri, S.; Gasmi, M.; Jaouadi, M.; Souissi, I.; Mimi, A.

Effect of Thermal Stratification on Phytoplankton and Nutrient Dynamics in a Regulated River (Saar, Germany)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						depth gradients; impounded river; impoundments; nutrients; phytoplankton dynamics; spatio-temporal variability; thermal stratification; weir pool	WEIR POOL; OXYGEN BUDGET; VARIABILITY; AUSTRALIA; ANABAENA; SYSTEMS	The weir pool Serrig is the deepest one along the impounded river Saar. Damming caused massive changes in the river's hydrodynamics. We analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of thermal density stratification in the weir pool and its effect on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics. In the analysis, continuous measurements from the years 2014 and 2015 were combined with three two-day sampling campaigns in spring 2015. Thermal stratification occurred regularly in the downstream section of the weir pool during spring and summer and showed a diurnal rhythm. Temperature differences >1K between the 1 and 2m water layer were observed during 34 out of 217days (16%) in 2014, with maximum temperature gradients up to 3.71K. Whereas the influence of thermal stratification on phytoplankton biomass and distribution was low during the algal bloom in early spring, stratification events between May and July promoted temporary algal blooms in the surface layer with chlorophyll a concentrations up to 98 mu g Chla l(-1) and a maximum difference between the 1 and 2m water layer of 36 mu g Chla l(-1). Some of the stratification events resulted in reduced concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the surface layer as a result of increased uptake by algae, with maximum gradients between the surface and the 8m water layer of 0.070mg ortho-PO43--P l(-1), 0.136mg NH4+-N l(-1) and 0.24mg NO3--Nl(-1). These vertical gradients should be considered in sampling protocols for the assessment of the water quality of temporarily stratified river sections. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ORC is a system that able to generate electricity with a low heat source temperature, making it suitable to be used to generate electricity with hot spring as heat source. Organic fluid is used as working fluid in the system. Temperature and volume flow rate of the hot spring is used as the data. The regions to be analyzed are area that has hot springs temperature between 70-80 degrees C. The cold water temperature to be used in the analysis was assumed 5 degrees C lower than ambient temperature. R227ea was chosen as working fluid in the system. The analysis begins by calculating hot spring mass flow rate to determine heat input. Analysis was continued by calculating heat output. End of the analysis are determiningturbine power and thermal efficiency. Results of the analysis indicate that Lompio - 1 is the area that has the highest electricity potential compared to other areas with 130.13 kW turbine power and thermal efficiency of 5.71%. Areas that have the lowest electricity potential is Kambahan with 1.14 kW turbine power and 5.63% thermal efficiency. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Akita-Yakeyama Volcano: Part 2. Secular variations of SO4/Cl ratios and their relationship to the phreatic eruptions	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Obuki hot spring; SO4/Cl ratios; Secular variation; Phreatic eruptions; Tracer model	KUSATSU-SHIRANE VOLCANO; YUGAMA CRATER LAKE; THERMAL SPRINGS; GEOTHERMAL AREA; POAS VOLCANO; SULFUR; CHEMISTRY; JAPAN; WATER; GEOCHEMISTRY	More than 70 years observation of the SO42-/Cl- molar ratios of water from the Obuki hot spring in the vicinity of Mt. Akita-Yakeyama volcano indicated that the ratio started increasing rapidly from 1973, peaked in 1980 (SO42-/Cl- = 0.34), remained at high values for about 18 years, then gradually decreased and returned to a normal baseline value (0.14) in 1991. The volcano erupted near the summit in 1948-1957 and again in 1997. The 1980 peak of SO42-/Cl- ratios may reflect the 1948 phreatic eruption of the volcano. Similarly, high SO42-/Cl- ratios were also observed in 2013 lasting for two years. The SO42-/Cl- peak in 2013 appeared 16 years after the 1997 phreatic explosion. The delayed appearance of the SO42-/Cl- peaks may represent slow upward movement of reservoir water to the surface after input of magmatic SO2 into the fluid reservoir which produced HSO4- through disproportionation reaction. The slow movement of water is supported by a long subsurface residence time (13-25 years) of reservoir fluid estimated from tritium measurement of the Obuki hot spring water. One-dimensional channel model was applied to analyze the effect of volcanic activity on SO42-/Cl- ratios of the Obuki hot spring water. The model supported the long travel time of the fluid implying that the effects of the 1997 eruption may appear in the spring water chemistry after about 29 years later, i.e., around 2026.

The thermal waters of the area have spring temperatures of 20-36 degrees C, pH of 6.4-7.5 and EC of 4960 to 5079 mu S/cm. Water type of thermal waters is generally Na-Cl type. Reservoir rocks of geothermal systems are marble and fissured schist units of Menderes Massif. Impermeable units of Neogene are the cap rocks of geothermal systems. Heat source of system is also geothermal gradient connected with tectonism. According to Giggenbach Diagram (1988), thermal waters mostly fall into the immature fields and reservoir temperatures vary between 55-114 degrees C. Mineral saturation in outlet temperatures indicates that calcite, aragonite, and dolomite minerals are generally oversaturated in the thermal waters. However, it is seen that the thermal waters is undersaturated with gypsum, anhydrite, celestite, and barite. It is determined that calcite, aragonite and dolomite minerals will be created scaling risk in production and conduction line of the thermal waters and during the reinjection of waste water. Silica minerals may also precipitate amorphous silica due to kinetic properties.

Thermal springs at Tapoban and Badrinanth area are the most well studied ones among several thermal manifestations present in this area. Lumped parameter models are used in this study to calculate the mean residence time of the thermal fluids using tritium concentrations of both precipitation and thermal water. Piston flow model (PFM), exponential mixing model or well mixed model (EMM), exponential piston flow (EPM) and dispersion model (DM) are used to estimate the mean transit time (MTT) of the thermal fluids. TracerLPM (version 1), an interactive Excel(*) (2007 or later) workbook program, is employed to carry out this modelling procedure. Historical records of weighted mean tritium concentration of precipitation at New Delhi GNIP station (representative of the study area) acts as input concentration in modelling procedure. Missing values of tritium concentrations at New Delhi GNIP station are derived by comparing the available tritium concentration data with the tritium records at Ottawa GNIP station, Canada. Ratio between tritium values of the two GNIP stations (New Delhi and Ottawa) indicates that tritium concentration in Ottawa can be scaled by the factor of 0.41 to match with the tritium concentration at New Delhi GNIP station. Among different lumped parameter models, the simulated tritium output concentration derived from EPM and DM matches closely with the measured tritium concentration of the thermal springs. The estimated mean transit time of the Tapoban thermal water (THS) is found to be between 40 and 44 years whereas for Badrinath thermal water (BTHS) it ranges from 102 to 112 years. Both the models (EPM and DM) suggest that the aquifer feeding the Tapoban thermal water (THS) contains mixture of water flow paths i.e. combination of both exponential and piston flow, whereas aquifer feeding the Badrinanth thermal water (BTHS) mostly contains exponential mixing portion. Hydrodynamic dispersion is found to be higher in the Badrinath system compared to the Tapoban thermal water system.	[Chatterjee, Sitangshu; Sinha, U.

Hydrogeochemical characteristics of thermal and cold waters in the Karakocan and Mazgirt districts were investigated for trace-element contents in the present study. Thermal and cold waters were collected in dry and rainy seasons to determine whether seasonal variations exist in the chemical composition of the waters. Based on the results, trace-element contents of thermal waters show seasonal changes, except for Co, Cs and Rb. Groundwater-rock and groundwater-clay/alteration mineral interactions are the main processes controlling the thermal and cold water trace-element content. Magmatic-sourced gases ascending through faults and fractures could be another source of B and Cl in thermal and cold waters in the study area. Clays and alteration products of K-minerals are the main sources of Rb and Cs in the thermal waters. High concentrations of As, Sb and Pb in thermal and cold waters are derived from groundwater-rock interaction. As and Sb mobilisation in the thermal waters is predominantly related to the reductive dissolution of Fe-oxyhydroxides and the oxidation of As and Sb containing Mg-Fe sulphur minerals in cold waters. Mixing of deep circulation thermal waters with the shallow cold water aquifers could also be responsible for high As, Sb and Pb concentrations in the cold groundwater.

THE THERMAL REGIME AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF FISH AND INVERTEBRATES IN KELLY WARM SPRING, GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, WYOMING	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article							CARASSIUS-AURATUS	We evaluated the thermal regime and relative abundance of native and nonnative fish and invertebrates within Kelly Warm Spring and Savage Ditch, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. Water temperatures within the system remained relatively warm year-round with mean temperatures > 20 degrees C near the spring source and > 5 degrees C approximately 2 km downstream of the source. A total of 7 nonnative species were collected: Convict/Zebra Cichlid (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum), Green Swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii), Tadpole Madtom (Noturus gyrinus), Guppy (Poecilia reticulata), Goldfish (Carassius auratus), red-rimmed melania snail (Melanoides tuberculata), and American bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus). Nonnative fish (Zebra Cichlids and Green Swordtails), red-rimmed melania snails, and bullfrog tadpoles dominated the upper 2 km of the system. Abundance estimates of the Zebra Cichlid exceeded 12,000 fish/km immediately downstream of the spring source. Relative abundance of native species increased moving downstream as water temperatures attenuated with distance from the thermally warmed spring source; however, non native species were captured 4 km downstream from the spring. Fish diseases were prevalent in both native and nonnative fish from the Kelly Warm Spring pond. Clinostomum marginatum, a trematode parasite, was found in native species samples, and the tapeworm Diphyllobothrium dendriticum was present in samples from nonnative species. Diphyllobothrium dendriticum is rare in Wyoming. Salmonella spp. were also found in some samples of nonnative species. These bacteria are associated with aquarium fish and aquaculture and are generally not found in the wild.

Chloride contribution by the granites seems to be slight. The Tuwa geothermal province is located within the triple junction which is the loci of Deccan volcanism. Granites and deep tectonic structures associated with the Deccan volcanism are the main contributors of high geothermal gradient and high heat flow in this province.	[Singh, H.

Thermal water is captured by five springs and borehole L-2. These waters are characterized by TDS content in the range of 160-230 mg/L and predominance of HCO3- (15-100% meq), SO42+ (10-36% meq), and Na+ (57-91% meq) ions. Increased concentrations of radon, hydrogen sulfide, and fluoride ions (7-13 mg/L) determine the medicinal properties of these waters, classified as thermal waters of Na-HCO3-(SO4), F-, H2S, Rn type, with temperatures of 18 to 30 degrees C and 41 to 45 degrees C in springs and in the L-2 borehole, respectively. At the turn of 2018 and 2019, a new borehole LZT-1 was drilled in the area of Ladek-Zdroj. It captured thermal waters with a temperature of 37.4 degrees C at the outflow. The water temperature at the bottom of the heated borehole reached about 59 degrees C. The lithology of rocks found in the recharged areas implied that the Ca2+ ions present in the studied waters originated from pyroxenes, amphiboles, calcite, calcium plagioclases, and fluorite. As for Na+ and K+ ions, they originate from sodium plagioclases, microcline, and orthoclase. The probable deposit temperature of waters from this borehole was estimated with the use of chemical geothermometers, as ranging from about 87 degrees C to 97 degrees C.

About 150-250 l/s of hydrothermal water, which attains boiling temperature at surface and 360 degrees C at depth, discharge from the Norris Geyser Basin, adjacent to the caldera. The highest thermal water and gas discharges in the corridor are from Mammoth Hot Springs, where 500-600 l/s thermal water with surface temperatures of up to 73 degrees C and calculated subsurface temperatures of similar to 100 degrees C issue from similar to 100 hot springs scattered over a score of step-like travertine terraces that range in age from similar to 0.4 Ma to recent. All the thermal water is meteoric, likely recharged in the Gallatin Range at 2.5-3.0 km elevations. The isotopic and chemical compositions of thermal waters and solutes can be interpreted to indicate a common magmatic source for heat and volatile solutes located near Norris. However, the chemical and isotopic compositions of gases, especially the He-3/He-4 ratios, provide strong evidence for a separate magmatic source for the Mammoth system.

Spring and aufeis (icing) hydrology in Brooks Range, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							RIVER; ISLAND	Remote sensing studies and field hydrometeorological and geophysical investigations were employed to characterize several aufeis fields in the Brooks Range, Alaska. Geochemical studies were undertaken together with field hydrological measurements to better understand the chemical and thermal properties of stream base flow (groundwater spring) that contributes to winter aufeis development. The spring water temperature was measured at several major aufeis fields using data loggers throughout the year. Aufeis is an important water storage component in the Arctic and influences local ecology and geomorphology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a useful and sensitive sensor for aufeis detection and for estimating the total volume of storage as well as freeze/thaw conditions. The SAR analysis indicated that the volume of aufeis formed in winter is 27 - 30% of the annual groundwater discharge in the Kuparuk River. Visible and near-IR satellite imagery indicated many of the high-discharge springs ( more than 10 - 1000 1/s) and aufeis fields are centered around an elevation of 600 m a. s.l. in limestone areas with glacial morphology. Geomorphological investigations indicate that many of springs have continually existed from at least the last glaciation. Microwave data ( SAR), thermal infrared, short wave infrared, and visible and near-IR bands were all used to observe the growth, decay, and distribution of aufeis deposits. The remotely sensed data indicate that the distribution of the aufeis deposits today is nearly the same as it was in past colder periods; this was mainly determined by mapping the distributed carbonate precipitates. Also, spring water temperatures and discharge volumes are predictable from the aufeis field size using remotely sensed techniques.

Assessing change in the overturning behavior of the Laurentian Great Lakes using remotely sensed lake surface water temperatures	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Laurentian Great Lakes; Overturning; Dimictic lake; Lake surface water temperature; Thermal front; Thermal bar; Lake stratification	THERMAL STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICHIGAN; BAR; STRATIFICATION; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; SUPERIOR; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESERVOIRS	Most large temperate lakes experience overturning every spring and fall as surface water moves past 4 degrees C, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater. These semiannual, lake-wide overturning events play an important role regulating the thermal structure, deep-water ventilation, nutrient supply, water circulation, and nearshore water quality of the lakes. The general pattern of overturning has long been known from field observations and models, but its timing, duration, detailed spatio-temporal progression and seasonal and inter-annual variability remain largely undocumented, particularly in the context of recent climate-driven changes in lake thermal dynamics. Here, we used a reconstructed record of daily and spatially-explicit lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) to analyze the migration of the 4 degrees C thermal front as it progressed from the shorelines to the deep parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes during every overturning event between June 1995 to April 2012. The analysis revealed a strong asymmetry in the timing and duration of overturning between spring and fall, and no relationship with the lake-averaged LSWT or its rate of change. Key differences in the average spatio-temporal progression of overturning were also observed between spring and fall, with the spring progression being largely driven by latitude and water depth and the fall progression being less predictable and influenced by other factors such as wind. Narrow regions of very slow overturning progression were also identified, revealing areas of the lakes where persistent 4 degrees C thermal bars are likely to re-occur every year. The timing and duration of these seasonal overturning events varied between years by as much as one and two months, respectively, with a direct impact on the duration of lake-wide stratification. In 2012, Lakes Michigan and Ontario experienced an incomplete fall overturning, leading only to a partial winter stratification. Lakes Michigan and Ontario were more susceptible to experience an incomplete overturning than the other Laurentian Great Lakes, seemingly due to a combination of comparatively milder winter air temperatures and lower lake dynamic ratio (steepness of bottom slope). Overall, the duration of lake-wide winter stratification was found to be strongly correlated with mean winter air temperatures, and a simple trend analysis suggested that rising temperatures could lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter stratifications in Lakes Michigan and Ontario over the next few decades. This study demonstrated that remote sensing provides an unparalleled tool for assessing the long-term variability in the overturning behavior of large lakes in the context of climate change.

The use of local renewable energy sources is one way to contribute to this effort. In the case of spa resorts, the use of heat from hot springs for therapeutic baths is an option. It is necessary to cool down this thermal mineral water to a temperature acceptable to the human body. However, due to the high mineral content of this water, heavy fouling can be a problem for conventional heat exchangers. The purpose of this study is to identify the suitable cooling technology in terms of required cooling capacity and waste heat recovery capability. The cooling technology was selected on the basis of a literature search. A pilot cooling unit consisting of vacuum cooler and plate heat exchanger was designed and tested in a real spa resort for six months. Both selected technologies have demonstrated the ability to cool thermal mineral water in long-term operation, as well as the possibility to utilize waste heat for domestic hot water heating. However, fouling problems occur in the plate heat exchanger. The vacuum cooler demonstrated greater operational robustness and resistance to encrustation.

Molecular analysis of the benthos microbial community in Zavarzin thermal spring (Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka, Russia)	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; SP-NOV.; GEN. NOV.; HOT-SPRINGS; ANAEROBIC BACTERIUM; THERMOPHILIC BACTERIUM; ARCHAEAL DIVERSITY; ORD. NOV; SULFUR; SULFURIHYDROGENIBIUM	Background: Geothermal areas are of great interest for the study of microbial communities. The results of such investigations can be used in a variety of fields (ecology, microbiology, medicine) to answer fundamental questions, as well as those with practical benefits. Uzon caldera is located in the Uzon-Geyser depression that is situated in the centre of the Karym-Semyachin region of the East Kamchatka graben-synclinorium. The microbial communities of Zavarzin spring are well studied; however, its benthic microbial mat has not been previously described. Results: Pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to study the benthic microbial community of the Zavarzin thermal spring (Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka). The community is dominated by bacteria (>95% of all sequences), including thermophilic, chemoorganotrophic Caldiserica (33.0%) and Dictyoglomi (24.8%). The benthic community and the previously examined planktonic community of Zavarzin spring have qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different, compositions. Conclusions: In this study, we performed a metagenomic analysis of the benthic microbial mat of Zavarzin spring. We compared this benthic community to microbial communities found in the water and of an integral probe consisting of water and bottom sediments. Various phylogenetic groups of microorganisms, including potentially new ones, represent the full-fledged trophic system of Zavarzin. A thorough geochemical study of the spring was performed.

At the same time, the search for former life on Mars has focussed on thermal spring deposits. For these reasons there is interest in the palaeobiology of ancient thermal spring deposits on Earth. Many such deposits are known but very few have been studied by palaeobiologists. The Devonian sinters of the Drummond Basin, Australia rank with the Rhynie cherts of Scotland as the oldest well established examples of fossil subaerial hot springs. The Drummond Basin sinters are closely comparable with modem examples in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and elsewhere. It is possible to recognise a range of palaeoenvironments from high temperature vents through former hot-water channelways and terraces to ambient temperature marsh deposits. Cyanobacterial stromatolites and microfossils are abundant in those palaeoenvitronments characterised by temperatures well above ambient, and the mash and other ambient temperature palaeoenvironments contain abundant herbaceous lycopsids and sphenopsids encrusted by microbial overgrowths.

The springs discharge more than 100 L/s at temperature ranging between 20 and 30 degrees C. They occur in a tectonic window of Mesozoic limestones in the central sector of the Acquasanta anticline within the Laga fore deep Basin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of thermal and cold fluids were investigated, most of them monitored for one year, in order to understand the thermal fluid circulation paths. The chemistry of the major elements defines the existence of Na-Cl and Ca-Cl-SO42- hot discharging waters and permits the characterization of the thermal end-member hosted in carbonate-dominated reservoir (Burano Anhydrites Fm-Calcare Massiccio Fm). This deep fluid is well represented by the sample T1 and shows high temperature and electrical conductivity (EC), very stable over time, and not affected by mixing phenomena. This is also confirmed by tritium results (0 T.U.). Close to the surface at different depth, such water undergoes mixing or dilution processes with HCO3- rich freshwaters, driven by the complex structural setting of the area and by diffuse karst caves. This is identified as the main reason for observed compositional variations of sampled springs, and three areas affected by different mixing phenomena have been defined at the surface. The concentrations of SO42- and H2S suggest redox processes affecting sulfur after interaction with evaporitic formations, identified with the Burano Anhydrites, at the base of the Umbria Marche sedimentary sequence (similar to 3500-m-deep). Contribution from this reservoir is also supported by characteristic Sr isotope signature. delta O-18 and delta D values indicate a meteoric origin of the thermal waters and allow estimation of an average infiltration altitude ranging between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. This datum, supported by structural data, suggests the Laga Mountains as the recharge area of the system. Reservoir temperature inferred by SO42--HCO3--F, Ca/Mg and SO42-/F geothermometers is about 80 degrees C, consistent with the geothermal gradient of the foredeep basin, and deserving further investigations for potential economic implications about this low-enthalpy geothermal area.

The white filaments were mainly composed of sulfur crystals surrounded by microbial mass of the phyla Epsilonbacteraeota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Patescibacteria. The most abundant genus in the white filaments collected from the waters in the innermost part of the cave dominated by sulfidic exhalations was Arcobacter. This abundance can be related to the higher concentration of sulfide dissolved in water, and low oxygen and pH values. Conversely, lower Arcobacter abundances were obtained in the filaments collected in the entrance and middle part of the cave, where sulfidic water mixes with seawater, as the cave is subjected to tides and the mixing of fresh (continental) with marine water. The geochemical analysis of water and atmospheric gases confirmed these environmental constraints. In fact, the highest concentrations of H2S in the air and water were recorded closest to the spring upwelling in the innermost part of the cave, and the lowest ones near the cave entrance.

The outflow temperature is close to 72 circle C, and the clear water contains about 1.4 g l(-1) total dissolved solids. The water contains predominantly Na and Cl, and significant and equal amounts of hydrogen carbonate and sulfate. The water originates from a fractured granite reservoir at about 5 km depth, suggested by the estimated Qtz and Na-K equilibrium temperatures of 130-150 degrees C. The solutes are derived from the interaction of the deep ground water with the solids of the fractured granite. However, the high Cl/Br mass ratio of about 550 in the deep water and the composition of surface runoff suggest the presence of an additional evaporite component introduced by surface infiltration. The source of this surface component is probably eolian deposits of halite, gypsum, and borate minerals from the salt flats and deserts of the Qaidam Basin on the slopes of the Qilian Mountains. The deep hydrothermal flow system is topography driven, and the upwelling water is focused and channeled to the damage zone of the Qilian border fault.

Geochemistry and geothermometry of Breitenbush Hot Springs, Oregon, USA	GEOTHERMICS			English	Article						Cascade Range; Geothermal; Isotope chemistry; Geothermometry; RTEst	CASCADE RANGE; HALOGEN CONCENTRATIONS; MINERAL SPRINGS; HEAT-FLOW; TEMPERATURE; SEDIMENTARY; SYSTEMATICS; ISOTOPES; WATERS	The aqueous chemistry, isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2), and geothermometry of the Breitenbush Hot Springs area in the central Oregon Cascades were examined. Water samples were collected from springs (5), wells (8), and the Breitenbush River (2). Geothermometry was interpreted using the Reservoir Temperature Estimator (RTEst) software package and constrained by the reported mineralogy. Reservoir temperature was calculated assuming equilibration with chalcedony, celadonite, laumontite, heulandite, and epidote. Because of its relatively rapid reaction rate, calcite was presumed to remain equilibrated during cooling of the ascending reservoir waters. CO2(g) degassing from the springs was accounted for by adjusting the carbon content and temperature to be consistent with a cooling curve passing through the chemical composition of the deep well waters. The average estimated reservoir temperature of 137.1 +/- 2.0 degrees C is lower than the 174 to 180 degrees C reported in other multicomponent geothermometric studies. However, our new estimate is consistent with mineralogical, aqueous geochemical, and fluid inclusion data, and with geothermal borehole temperature measurements near the site. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope data indicate that the thermal waters at Breitenbush and Austin Hot Springs are a mixture of 4 to 8% "andesitic water" (Giggenbach, 1992) and local meteoric waters recharged at elevations of 1750 to 2200 m, along the crest of the Cascade Mountains. Br/Cl ratios, delta O-18, and delta D, and their correlation with Cl- concentrations from our study combined with data and analyses from other sources, suggests that Cl-, other halogens, and CO2 in the Breitenbush hot springs are primarily derived from degassing fluids rising from the serpentinized forearc mantle. The calculated reservoir temperature and average measured thermal water Cl- concentration were used with previously reported chloride-flux-based measurements by the USGS to estimate a hydrothermal discharge of 13.7 +/- 1.6 L/s and an advective heat discharge of 7.1 +/- 0.8 MW. This calculated hydrothermal heat loss is slightly less than Ingebritsen et al.'s (1992) previous estimate of 9 MW. However, it still represents a substantial transfer of heat from a relatively small, constant groundwater discharge.

Freshwater, mineral and thermal water discharges occur in the archipelago, and especially at the Fogo and Furnas volcanoes (Sao Miguel). These discharges provide data for case studies of groundwater chemistry from volcanic monitoring due to the stable composition of the sampled waters. The mineral and thermal discharges are mainly of sodium bicarbonate types and present a large range of temperatures, from cold springs to waters at about 90 degreesC. Some boiling discharges have a sulfate-dominated composition, suggesting a steam-heating mechanism. Geochemical studies on these mineral and thermal waters began in the 19th century. Data gathered since these earlier studies provide a baseline for pH, temperature, CO2 and major-element composition. Weekly measurements of pH and temperature also denote a rather stable behavior.

Chemical and isotopic contents were employed in the investigation on the origin and evolution of thermal water and the evaluation of reservoir temperature in the geothermal systems. Thermal waters in Wushan and Tianshui are characterized by outlet temperatures from 15 to 38A degrees C and low TDS (226-255 mg/L), defined as bicarbonate water. Its origin may be attributed to the interaction between meteoric rain, biotite plagioclase gneiss and carbonate reservoir rocks. In contrast, thermal waters in Tongwei and Qingshui have higher outlet temperatures of 25-54.2A degrees C and a moderate TDS of 915-1,793 mg/L, regarded as sulfate waters. These sulfate waters may arise from the interaction between meteoric water, granite and amphogneiss. Isotopic data presented here suggest that thermal waters in the study area have a meteoric origin without being significantly effected by water-rock isotope exchange. Chemical geothermometry indicates the existence of a deep geothermal reservoir of low-to-medium enthalpy (70-111A degrees C) in the Tianshui study area.

In order to understand the formation mechanism of sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring and provide a better insight into the sulfur isotope geochemistry of the associated Rehai hydrothermal system, we investigated the spring water hydrochemistry, mineralogy and major-element geochemistry of sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring together with the sulfur-oxygen isotope geochemistry of sulfur-containing materials at the Rehai geothermal field and compared the isotope results with those in other steam-heated environments. Subaerial minerals include a wide variety of sulfate minerals (gypsum, alunogen, pickeringite, tamarugite, magnesiovoltaite and a minor Mg-S-O phase) and amorphous SiO2. The delta S-34 values of the subaerial sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring varied subtly from -0.33 to 1.88 parts per thousand and were almost consistent with the delta S-34 values of local H2S (-2.6 to 0.6 parts per thousand) and dissolved SO42- (-0.2 to 5.8 parts per thousand), while the delta O-18 values (-8.94 to 20.1 parts per thousand) were between that of the spring waters (-10.19 to -6.7 parts per thousand) and atmospheric O-2 (similar to 23.88 parts per thousand). The results suggest that most of the sulfate minerals are derived from the oxidation of H2S, similar to many sulfate minerals from modern steam-heated environments. However, the rapid environmental change (different ratio of atmospheric and water oxygen) at the Zhenzhu Spring accounts for the large variation of delta O-18. The formation of subaerial sulfate minerals around the Zhenzhu Spring is related to acid aerosols (vapour and acid water droplets). The intense activity of spring water around vents supply the aerosol with H2SO4 (H2S oxidation and acid water droplets formed by bubble bursting) and few cations. Deposition of the acid sulfate aerosol forms the acid condensate, which attacks the underlying rocks and releases many cations and anions to form subaerial sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring.

J	VANEVERDINGEN, RO				VANEVERDINGEN, RO			PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASPECTS OF CANADIAN SPRINGS	MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA			English	Article								Springs, or points of natural, concentrated groundwater discharge, may be located in river or lake beds, or below mean sea level along the coast, but many are found some distance from surface-water bodies. Spring water commonly represents rain or snowmelt that has entered the ground at a higher elevation a number of years earlier. Measured springwater temperatures in Canada range from very cold (-2.9-degrees-C) to hot (82.2-degrees-C). Thermal spring waters, with temperatures above the local mean-annual air temperature, have undergone geothermal heating during deep subsurface circulation in areas of high topographic relief. Hot springs (> 37-degrees-C) are therefore found only in mountainous areas, in Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. Spring locations are commonly controlled by major folding or faulting, or both, in the bedrock strata. Reported pH values in Canadian spring waters range from strongly acidic to alkaline (2.8 to > 10.0). Low pH values (< 4.0) are associated with high contents of dissolved Fe (up to 2600 mg.L-1) and other heavy metals (e.g. Zn up to 177 mg.L-1), resulting from the oxidation of metal sulfides. Measured redox potentials (Eh) range from -252 to +683 mV. Negative Eh values are found in spring waters that contain dissolved H2S and S2-, produced by bacterial reduction of dissolved sulfate. Total-dissolved-solids contents of Canadian spring waters are reported to range from as little as 32 to over 75 000 mg.L-1. Chemical composition also varies widely. Major anions include bicarbonate (up to 5960 mg.L-1), sulfate (up to 17 520 mg.L-1), and chloride (up to 44 300 mg.L-1). Major cations include calcium (up to 1823 mg.L-1), magnesium (up to 1190 mg.L-1), sodium (up to 27 100 mg.L-1, and potassium (up to 1568 mg.L-1). The chemical composition of each spring water reflects the mineral composition of the rock types with which the water has been in contact, as well as its subsurface residence time. In simplified terms, Ca-Mg/HCO3 waters come from carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite), Ca/SO4 waters from gypsum or anhydrite, and Na/Cl waters from salt beds. Springwater temperature and composition can both show gradual (seasonal) and sudden (incidental) variations. In springs that show seasonal variations, maximum temperature and mineralization occur near the end of winter; minimum values commonly occur during snowmelt. Sudden variations in temperature, mineralization, and discharge rate can occur during periods of heavy rain, if cold, non-mineralized rainwater enters spring conduits. Earthquakes may cause sudden changes in discharge rates and suspended-solids contents, without affecting water temperature or chemical composition. Information on Canadian spring locations, and on their physical and chemical character, is still spotty. As detailed knowledge about springs can be useful in both ecological and water-supply studies, an effort should be made to expand and refine the existing database.

However, almost nothing is known about viral contributions to community dynamics and ecosystem function in such environments. In the present study, sediment/mat and water samples from 2 separate thermal areas (Mickey and Borax) within the Alvord Desert Basin, Oregon, USA, were analyzed for prokaryotic and viral abundance, viral decay and production. Springs sampled at Mickey ranged in temperature from 61 to 94 degrees C, and those at Borax from 61 to 96 degrees C; all springs were near-neutral in pH. The total number of virus-like particles (106 particles ml(-1), Yo-Pro-1) exceeded total prokaryotic cell counts (DAPI staining, 105 cells ml-1). Virus to bacterium ratios for these systems ranged from 4.81 to 18.87. Viral production and decay rates were determined for sediment/mat samples and water from each hot spring; viral turnover rates ranged from 0.27 to 1.00 h(-1). Lysis rates of approximately 9.50% of cells h-1 in Borax springs vs. 21.70% in Mickey springs were extrapolated from viral production rates. Decay rates determined from hot springs at Mickey ranged from 0.09 to 0.20 h(-1), corresponding to turnover times of 5 to 11 h, while decay rates at Borax corresponded to viral turnover times of 12 to 14 h. Exposure of water samples to mitomycin C yielded lysogeny rates of 18 to 21 % for the total prokaryotic communities in any given sample. Together, these data show that viruses exert an important influence on microbial communities and play a significant role in extreme thermal environments.

J	MALM, J; JONSSON, L				MALM, J; JONSSON, L			WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS AND THERMAL BAR EVOLUTION DURING SPRING IN LAKE LADOGA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							SATELLITE	The present article is a study of the surface temperature distribution and its evolution during spring in Lake Ladoga, using NOAA-AVHRR Channel 4/Channel 5 (CH4/CH5) data, with special focus on a thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called thermal bar. The split-window technique, where both constant and atmospheric-mass-dependent retrieval coefficients are tested, is used for calculating the atmosphere effects in the temperature derivation. The satellite-derived temperature data are compared with field data from six different years. The results show that on average, the satellite-derived temperatures exceed the in situ data by approximately 0.5-degrees-C. The relative advantages of images from day or night passes for the study of the thermal bar is also discussed. Surface temperature differences in the convectively mixed region (temperatures less than 4-degrees-C) show that day temperatures are on the order of 0.5-degrees-C higher than the night temperatures. However, the surface temperatures from day images seem to be more representative of the bulk temperature in a water column. A comparison of the thermal bar progression in Lake Ladoga during spring 1988 as obtained from satellite images and as predicted by a simple theoretical model shows good agreement. This result and results from an earlier study indicate that the model is a good prediction tool for thermal bar movement in large temperate lakes.

Hydrology and hydrogeology of Sakaryabasi karstic springs, Cifteler, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						groundwater potential; karst hydrogeology; karst hydrogeochemistry; isotope hydrology; Sakaryabasi karst springs; Central Anatolia; Sakarya River; hydrology of Turkey		The Sakarya River is one of the largest rivers in Turkey and is fed mainly from Sakaryabasi springs. The Sakaryabasi springs are located in the Central Anatolia and issue from confined/semi-confined karst having a thermal component and therefore, having quite different hydrogeological characteristics as compared to the Taurus Karst region, a typical example of the Mediterranean type of karst. The karstic carbonate rocks that form the groundwater reservoir are overlain by a thick semi-pervious overburden of mainly clastics of Neogene age. Tectonics is the major factor controlling the occurrence of the karst springs in the area where topography is rather flat. This study aimed at explaining the occurrence and movement of the karst groundwater within the system by use of hydrogeological, chemical, and isotopic tools. Isotopic composition of the waters revealed that all waters in the region are of meteoric origin and the thermal component is due to deep circulation. The catchment area of the hydrogeological system extends to the south and groundwater movement is towards the outlets, which are in a depression along a major fault. The movement of the groundwater, based on analysis of remotely sensed images, is controlled mainly by structural elements.

J	Dinh, CN; Nowak, J				Dinh, Chau Nguyen; Nowak, Jakub			Natural Radioactivity in Thermal Waters: A Case Study from Poland	ENERGIES			English	Article						thermal waters; utilisation; recreational bathing; radioactivity; natural radionuclides	GEOTHERMAL WATERS; RADIONUCLIDES; GROUNDWATER; URANIUM; RA-226; REMOVAL; SPRINGS; RN-222; SPAS	A natural radioactivity in thermal water was investigated based on 19 selected thermal waters from Poland. The analysed results show that the radionuclides' concentrations in the study waters vary over a wide range. The temperature of the waters varies from above 20 degrees C to above 80 degrees C. The waters are characterised by different mineralisation, chemical compositions, and belong to different hydrochemical types. There is a good correlation between the water temperature and the depths of the aquifer formations occurrence, suggesting the thermal energy originates from the thermal geogradient. The concentration of radium is well correlated with the water mineralisation. The ratio of radium activity (Ra-226/Ra-228) in groundwater relates not only the ratio of uranium activity to that of thorium (U-238/Th-232) in aquifer formation, but also depends on the physical and chemical water properties. Based on the concentration of radon and its transport model, the radiation exposures due to inhalation of Rn-222 and its progeny for employees and clients of the spa were assessed. The use of the thermal waters as a drinking resource may be problematic due to the possibility of exceeding the recommended annual committed effective dose 0.1 mSv.

J	Gbah, MB; Murthy, RC				Gbah, MB; Murthy, RC			Characteristics of turbulent cross and alongshore momentum exchanges during a thermal bar episode in Lake Ontario	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article							FRONTS	Time series flow data obtained during the thermal bar episode of 17 April to 24 May 1990 in Lake Ontario are analyzed to provide a kinematic description of the coastal flow and cross-margin exchange characteristics. A thermal bar is a shore-parallel front which separates descending waters at or near the fresh water temperature of maximum density (4 degrees C) during Spring and Fall seasons. Thermal bars are important because of their influence mixing, cross-shore exchanges, and the variability of biotic factors in coastal zones. The analysis shows that cross-frontal exchange coefficients, K-y, are nearly constant and consistently smaller than along-frontal counterparts, K-x, Moreover, these exchange coefficients are several orders of magnitude smaller than typical coastal and oceanic values in the absence of the bar. The turbulent kinetic energy represents less than 6% of the total kinetic energy in the flow. These results suggest that small-scale horizontal fluctuations and cross-frontal turbulent momentum exchanges are severely inhibited in the spring during the thermal bar.

BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY			English	Article						Acid spring; Magmatic fluid; Neutralization; Steamheating; H2S oxidation; Mixing	YUNNAN PROVINCE; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; THERMAL WATERS; FIELD; GEOCHEMISTRY; HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY; NEVADO; TIBET	Across mainland China, Tengchong is geothermally unique because both magmatic-hydrothermal systems and late Cenozoic volcanic activities have been observed there. Rehai, located in the Tengchong volcanic area, is the only hydrothermal system in mainland China discharging acid springs with very low pH values. Two types of acid geothermal waters were identified: one is sulfate waters with low chloride concentrations and pH levels as low as around 2; the other has slightly higher chloride concentrations and is marked with diversified hydrochemical types. Both types of acid springs at Rehai are immature waters and far from being equilibrated with a thermodynamically stable mineral assemblage comprising albite, K-feldspar, muscovite, and clinochlore characteristic for felsic rock-hosted reservoirs. In contrast to those neutral chloride springs at Rehai that are formed via boiling, conductive cooling or mixing with cold groundwaters of a parent geothermal liquid (PGL), the sulfate-rich acid waters discharged from the Diretiyan area, the Dagunguo area, and the Shizitou Spring of Rehai are essentially locally perched groundwaters heated by H2S-rich steam separated from deep geothermal fluid. The acidity of these waters originates from the oxidation of H2S in near-surface environment. In contrast, the acid waters with higher chloride concentrations are the results of mixing between steam-heated waters and neutral chloride waters. The geochemical geneses of the Rehai geothermal springs inferred based on stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are generally identical. Unlike active volcanic areas across the world, there is a lack of acid waters at Rehai formed through partial neutralization of magmatic fluid, possibly owing to the comparatively deep-seated magma chamber there (no less than 7 km deep).

The AN is a typical boiling system, with Na-Cl waters (TDS 1 g/I), low gas content (CO2-N-2), with deep calculated temperatures of similar to 200 degrees C. In contrast, springs of the K system have lower temperatures (up to 42 degrees C), strong gas bubbling, TDS similar to 2.5 VI, and are enriched in HCO3- and SO42-, with Mg2+ as the main cation. There are two intriguing characteristics of the K field: (i) their CO2-rich gas (>97 mol%) has the highest He-3/He-4 ratios ever measured for hydrothermal systems in Kamchatka of similar to 8 Ra (where Ra = 1.4 x 10(-6)) and (ii) their thermal waters have an unusual cation composition (Mg > Na > Ca). After the 1996 sublimnic eruption within AN caldera, new hot springs appeared close to the eruption site. In this paper we synthesize all published and new geochemical data sets. The Karymsky Lake and post similar to 1996 new thermal springs demonstrate exponential decreases in their main dissolved species, with a characteristic time of 5 to 8 years. The chemistry of AN and K springs did not change after the eruption. However, the concentration of chloride in the lake water approached similar to 35 mg/l, compared with a background of 8-11 mg/l revealing a possible new source of hot water within the Karymsky Lake. All thermal fields of the KVC are drained by the Karymsky River with an outflow rate at the source of similar to 2 m(3)/s (flowing out from Karymsky Lake) and at the exit from the Karymsky caldera of similar to 4.5 m(3)/s. Using the measured solute fluxes at the source (AN springs) and at the exit (AN + K springs) the natural heat flux from the two systems can be estimated as similar to 67 MW and similar to 120 MW, respectively, and 20 t/d for the chloride output from both systems.

Mean bottom water temperatures for the season and during cold water intrusions were significantly warmer in 2012 than 2013 leading to a significantly reduced stratified season in 2012. Cold water intrusions were driven into southern Green Bay by southerly winds while intrusions were terminated when winds switched to persistent northerly winds. 2012 observed a significant increase in northerly winds relative to 2013, decreasing cold water intrusion presence and duration but winds did not fully explain the difference in thermal conditions for southern Green Bay. These cold bottom waters drive stratification in polymictic southern Green Bay while dimictic waters were found to have significantly warmer bottom temperatures during 2012 and a deeper mixed layer. Our observations suggest that relatively shallow (<20 m), seasonally stratified systems may not increase in stratification strength and duration under a warming climate; rather, changing wind climatology and surface heat flux can inform the degree to which the mixing regime can be expected to change and impact stratification and thermal structure of coastal systems. We discuss the biogeochemical implications of different thermal regimes, particularly within the context of multiple drivers of physical water column structure in eutrophic, stratified coastal systems.

A pool adjacent to a sinkhole was filled with approximately 13,000 L of water. After tracers were added and thoroughly mixed, the pool was emptied into the sinkhole. Data were collected at Freiheit Spring approximately 95 m north of the sinkhole to monitor spring responses. Flow peaked first at the spring, and suspended sediment peaked next. Then nearly identical uranine, chloride, and delta D peaks occurred. Temperature was the last of the tracers to peak. The initial increase in flow at the spring recorded the time at which the water reached a submerged conduit, sending a pressure pulse to the spring at approximately the speed of sound in open water. The initial increase in uranine, chloride, and delta D at the spring recorded the arrival of the recharge water. The initial change in temperature and its peak occurred later than the same features in the uranine, chloride, and delta D breakthrough curves. As water flowed along this flow path, water exchanged heat with the aquifer, producing a lagged, damped thermal peak at the spring. The combination of hydraulic response and conservative and nonconservative tracers illustrates unique pressure, advective, and nonconservative processes. Geometrical properties of the flow system may be estimated using these tracers. By summing discharge between the time of the initial increase in stage produced by a pressure pulse in a fully phreatic flow path and the time of the chloride peak, the conduit volume is estimated as 47 +/- 10% m(3). Heat transport simulations were used to reproduce the modified thermal signal, and simulations with planar flow paths and hydraulic diameters of 7 and 8 cm produced the best fits to the observed temperature breakthrough curve. These volume and hydraulic diameter estimates together predict a bedding plane flow path that is 3.5 cm high by 9 m wide or 4 cm high by 8 m wide. The different tracers provide complementary information, and the combination of parameters provides useful constraints on flow path geometry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The geothermometry results indicate that the geothermal resources in south and central Vietnam are of medium enthalpy. These results confirm those of previous geochemical surveys and indicate that the most promising geothermal sites in Vietnam are Le Thuy, south of Dong Hoi and Mo Duc near Quang Nghai. (C) 1997 CNR.

But at the complex geological setting like Sulawesi the geothermal systems probably is not only influenced by volcanic activities but also structural geology features. Sarawet hot spring in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, Indonesia is a volcanic and fault influenced manifestations. Sarawet hot spring is located in north coast Minahasa. Our study shows that the surface geological-structural analysis in combination with the geochemistry and the heat flow investigation is the essential tools for geothermal systems or manifestation characterization. Tectonics, crust characteristic, heat flow, and surface structural could affect the manifestations and its geothermal systems. Geochemically the water is bicarbonate, peripheral-immature water, and characterized by a meteoric water-line trend. The composition of these thermal springs was controlled by a secondary process during ascent. Based on hydrologic gradient, heat flow characteristic and subsurface structural analysis, the mechanism of Sarawet hot spring is a lateral outflow that affected by dynamically maintained fractures system.

J	GEORGE, LD				GEORGE, LD			USES OF SPRINGWATER	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						SPRINGWATER; THERAPEUTIC VALUES OF SPRINGWATER; BOTTLED WATER		The many uses of springwater around the world span history. Springwater has been used for basic survival, medicinal purposes, and for man's entertainment, pleasure, and dalliance. Hippocrates and ancient Greek physicians were versed in the health benefits of mineral water therapy. In early recorded history, the Egyptians, Arabians, and Mohammedans discussed the use of mineral waters for healing the ill. Mythology and legend date the thermal springs of Bath, England, to 800 BC. Hannibal refreshed himself with bubbling springwater at Vergeze on his way to attack Rome in 218 BC. Therapeutic application of mineral waters was very popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Significant expenditures were made throughout Europe and the United States to develop lavish resorts and vacation spots at the famous mineral springs. The Romans may have initiated the uses of mineral waters, but the French are traditionally the modern developers and promoters of bottled waters. Evian was exported to the United States as early as 1905. Mountain Valley, of Hot Springs, Arkansas, has been bottled since 1871. Poland Spring water of Maine has been distributed since the mid-1800s. Springwater has become the health drink of today. Uses of springwater through time, famous springs and famous consumers of springwater, and the therapeutic attributes of springwater are summarized in the following paper. Research included technical, nontechnical, and trade information. The paper provides a retrospective of historical aspects of the development of springwaters, a concise summary of medicinal characteristics of springwater, and insight to commercial enterprise of bottled water.

This analysis focused on reach scale heterogeneity in water temperatures as influenced by local influx of cooler subsurface waters. Using field thermal probes and recording thermistors, we identified and characterized cold water patches (at least 3degreesC colder than ambient streamflow temperatures) potentially serving-as thermal refugia for cold water fishes. Among 37 study sites within alluvial valleys of the Grande Ronde basin in northeastern Oregon, we identified cold water patches associated with side channels, alcoves, lateral seeps, and floodplain spring brooks. These types differed with regard to within floodplain position, area, spatial thermal range, substrate, and availability of cover for fish. Experimental shading cooled daily maximum temperatures of surface waters within cold water patches 2 to 4degreesC, indicating a strong influence of riparian vegetation on the expression of cold water patch thermal characteristics. Strong vertical temperature gradients associated with heating of surface layers of cold water patches exposed to solar radiation, superimposed upon vertical gradients in dissolved oxygen, can partially restrict suitable refuge volumes for stream salmonids within cold water patches.

J	Arif, IA				Arif, IA			Composition of blue-green algal mats and water chemistry of the Bani Malik hot spring (Gizan Province), Saudi Arabia	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article							VEGETATION; SULFIDE	The ecology of microbial mats, water chemistry and invertebrates in the Bani Malik hot spring (Gizan Province) Saudi Arabia are presented. Various forms of thick algal mars were identified. They exhibited significant growths and occurred in a temperature gradient (45-50 degrees C) in a natural stream. An abundance of Phormidium/Oscillatoria, Synechococcus lividus and Calothrix/Pleurocapsa occurred as visually-obvious mats, In the mats were discrete groupings which were recognizable by their morphologies and color discriminations. These outgrowths were regarded as a nuisance by the area development authority. A community apparently not previously recorded in the thermal springs of Saudi Arabia was abundant in a deep thermal pool. This consisted of clusters of pedicellate nodular mats predominated by Calothrix thermalis (90%) with the remainder contributed by Pleurocapsa minor (10%). A cross-section of the mat revealed striking laminations composed of an outer thin cover (Synechococcus spp.), followed by a middle thick zone (Calothrix thermalis/Pleurocapsa minor) and finally a central zone (calcite crystals) of a rather firm consistency. The other biological structure consisted of intermittent old and dead filaments of C. thermalis, with a few insect larvae associated within the mat. The overwhelmingly lothic algal community in a hydrogen sulfide-rich thermal pool appeared to play an active role in the photosynthetic activity, resulting in aeration (O-2 = 3.5 mg/l) of the waterbody. The water may be characterized as slightly to-moderately alkaline with high concentrations of reactive-Si (44 mg/l), Cl- (217 mg/l) and SO2-4 (613 mg/l). The water of the spring orifice contained hydrogen sulfide (> 5 mg/l).			Arif, IA (corresponding author), KING SAUD UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT BOT & MICROBIOL,RIYADH 11451,SAUDI ARABIA.

Yamkun spring is known as one of the few radioactive springs in Transbaikal region. Its waters were used for the treatment of Kaschin-Beck disease (Urov disease), nowadays the regional center of medical rehabilitation for the treatment of diseases of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, including cerebral palsy, and diseases of the skin is working on the basis of this spring. The main aim of the research is to identify mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of Yamkun spring components. Objects: lake and stream water, travertines, ferruginous sediments in the stream bed, salt sediments on the tube of soak well, vegetation (lichens, mosses, pine straw, poplar leaves). Methods: inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry, instrumental neutron activation analysis, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy. Results. Water of Yamkun spring is bicarbonate, calcium-magnesium, radioactive of radon nature. It is significantly enriched in Mn, Fe, Be, As, Zr, Cs, Hg, Tl, Li, Co and Ba relative to water of Lake Baikal. Water enrichment with rare alkaline and alkaline-earth elements (Li, Be, Cs), as well as Hg, Tl, As and Zr suggests that their source is rare-metal granitoids. During water discharge we observed modern mineral formation on the surface of water baths as "Yamkun foam" (aragonite), tubes of soak well (nesquehonite) and in the stream (ferruginous sediments). Ferruginous sediments and travertines are represented mainly with magnesian calcite. In the ferruginous sediments we identified in large quantities Fe and Mn compounds, probably hydroxides. The hydroxides of Mn also include Ba, K, Cl compounds, Fe hydroxides - As, P, Si, Al. Rare microinclusions in the travertines are represented with intermetallic phases of Cu and Sn, La-Ce carbonate and As sulphide (loellingite?). The inheritance of composition of modern ferruginous sediments and travertines is established. The forming travertines are enriched with the same elements as the water in the spring.

Boiling chloride spring waters discharge over a 30 m vertical interval from the Steaming Cliffs along the western shore of Lake Rotomahana (similar to 340 m asl) to inferno Crater (373 m asl) in the upper Waimangu Valley. K-Na and K-Mg ratios, aqueous silica concentrations and Delta O-18((sulfate-water)) values of spring waters, indicate deep equilibration temperatures that range from 200 to 280 degrees C, while uniform B/Cl ratios (similar to 0.0075) suggest the chloride waters derive from a single reservoir. Stable isotope data are best explained as the result of boiling and dilution in the upper part (<2 lan depth) of the system, with an interpreted parent liquid composition of Cl=585 mg/kg, delta(18)O = -4.75 parts per thousand, and delta D = -37.5 parts per thousand. This liquid is distinct from the parent inferred for the nearby Waiotapu geothermal system and is positively enriched in both delta(18)O and delta D compared to focal meteoric water (delta(18)O = -6.85 parts per thousand, delta D = -42 parts per thousand). Boiling upflow is interpreted to dominate beneath all surface features except in the vicinity of Lake Rotomahana, where a cold hydrostatic cap (similar to 100 m thick) depresses the temperature gradient of rising fluids discharging at Steaming Cliffs. The effects of ground water dilution generally increase with hot spring elevation in response to a steepening hydraulic gradient and rugged topography associated with the volcanic craters of Waimangu Valley. A minimum chloride Bur estimate of 80-100 g/s corresponds to athermal output of 150 to 190 MW.

This study investigated the action of bacterial lysates that were isolated from Comano spring water on in vitro culture of human skin fibroblasts. Methods: For this study, we selected the following four bacterial lysates: L1 (closest relative: Rudaea cellulosilytica), L2 (closest relative: Mesorhizobium erdmanii), L3 (closest relative: Herbiconiux ginsengi), and L4 (closest relative: Fictibacillus phosphorivorans). Human fibroblasts were cultured under Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with bacterial lysates added or DMEM (controls). Cell proliferation was evaluated by spectrophotometric absorbance analysis after the XTT-Microculture Tetrazolium Assay. Results: At 24 hours, cultures with L2, L3, and L4 showed a higher absorbance compared with controls. At 48 hours, cultures with L1, L2, and L3 showed slightly lower absorbance compared with controls, and culture with L4 showed a higher absorbance than in the other experimental conditions. At 72 hours, absorbance was lower in cultures with L1, L2, and L3 than in controls, and absorbance was higher in culture with L4 than in the other experimental conditions. Conclusions: Our study indicates a favorable action of Comano spring water microbiota on proliferation of human skin fibroblasts.

However, minor variations in physicochemical properties; TOC, sodium, chloride, zinc and nitrate were observed, including the pH of the spring openings. Illumina based amplicon sequencing revealed Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi as the major bacterial phylum with higher abundance in the DJ04 sample. The alpha diversity of all the springs was almost same, whereas beta diversity revealed variations in the degree of uniqueness of OTUs at different temperatures. Statistical analysis established a positive correlation between sulfur content with Heliobacterium, Thermodesulfovibrio, Thermodesulfobacterium and Herpetosipho as well as TOC and HCO3 with Thermoanaerobacter, Desulfovibrio, Candidatus solibacter and Dehalogenimona. The major hydrocarbon family genes and Carbohydrate Active Enzyme pathways were predicted to be highest in DJ04 with elevated concentrations of HCO3 and TOC. Higher homogeneity in geo-physicochemical and microbial features direct the possibility of the common origin of these springs through plumbing systems. However, the minor variations in diversity and functionality were due to variations in temperature in spring openings through the mixing of subsurface water contaminated with carbohydrates from leaf biomass litter. Functional characterization of the thermophilic bacteria of this spring provides essential scope for further industrial applications. The biogeochemical reasons hypothesized for the genesis of unique multiple openings in the cluster are also of interest to conservation scientists for taking measures toward necessary laws and regulations to protect and preserve these springs.

J	Stoyneva, MP				Stoyneva, MP			Survey on green algae of Bulgarian thermal springs	BIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Biology and Taxonomy of Green Algae	JUN 24-28, 2002	SMOLENICE, SLOVAKIA			green algae; thermes; hot springs; Bulgaria		High-temperature aquatic environments are extreme habitats that are inimical for many organisms and particularly for eukaryotic algae. The present report provides data on chlorophytes occurring in this extreme habitat type from a region of Bulgaria interesting from tectonics and biodiversity. The Bulgarian phycological literature was reviewed and all records were summarized in order to present a complete information about the species composition of green algae, their distribution and role in the communities in various Bulgarian thermal waters. Additionally, information on the state and species composition of four thermal sites visited in 2002 is provided. Thermo-mineral waters in Bulgaria are heterogeneous and belong to 4 hydromineral formations. Most of them have been well investigated hydrogeologically and hydrochemically but studies on their algae are quite scarce. However, the existing data show a rich algal flora in thermal springs and their main floods, consisting of more than 200 species, varieties and forms of cyanoprokaryotes, glaucophytes, diatoms, green, yellow-green and red algae. Chlorophyta were represented by 75 taxa and comprised a significant part of the total algal diversity. In the generic structure green algae also occupied prominent position with 26 genera of a total of 67. Most of the chlorophytes were documented for one site. Only the sterile filaments of Spirogyra and Zygnema were more widely distributed in thermal waters. Where data on algal abundance were given in the literature, they were based only on qualitative relative scales. But according to both old descriptions and our own recent observations, it is clear that green algae play important roles in the thermal algal communities, forming the main masses of the floating mats, attached tufts or submerged fields.

The complex geological-structural and geomorphological conditions of Albania have resulted in the formation of diverse aquifers with regard to their hydraulic type, resources, hydrodynamics and hydrochemical characteristics. Among them there are some deep aquifers associated with different rocks like evaporate, carbonate and molasse, hosting thermal waters. Based on geological conditions, as well as hydrochemical and thermal characteristics, four hydrochemical water types and four related provinces of thermal waters are distinguished in Albania. H2S, SO4-Ca-type waters (temperature 43 degrees C) originate from evaporite rocks of the Korab Province. Samples of the Cl-Na-Ca or Cl-SO4-Na-Ca-type, of varying temperatures and H2S concentrations, originate from deep-lying limestone-dolomite anticline structures of the Kruja Province. Most samples from the Pre-Adriatic Depression Province related to deep-laying Neogene, mainly Tortonian, sandstone aquifers are of the Na-Cl water type with H2S and CH4 gases and usually with high Br and J concentrations. A few water samples from the Ionian Province are of the Cl-Na water-type and measure varying temperatures. For each province the geological-structural, thermal and hydrochemical characteristics are described in the paper. The richest province in terms of thermal water resources is the Kruja Province, where most of the warm and hot thermal H2S springs are located.

Effects of thermal and hydrophysical properties of sandy Haplic Podzol on actual evapotranspiration of spring wheat	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS			English	Article						Soil; Thermal properties; Hydrophysical properties; Actual evapotranspiration	SURFACE-ENERGY-BALANCE; WATER-CONTENT; HEAT-FLUX; SOIL; MOISTURE; TEMPERATURE; INERTIA; GRASSLAND	The objectives of the research were to: (1) assess the strength of relationships between the soil thermal and hydrophysical properties, (2) evaluate the strength of association of evapotranspiration of spring wheat crop with soil thermal and hydrophysical properties, and (3) estimate the ranges of the thermal and hydrophysical properties of the sandy Haplic Podzol during the growing period of spring wheat in 2022. The study included instrumental simultaneous measurements of meteorological data, soil water retention curve, soil moisture content (SMC) and thermal properties. Actual evapotranspiration was calculated according to the Allen equation. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients showed that the increase in SMC from 0.10 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.26 cm(3) cm(-3) resulted in a significant increase in thermal conductivity (r = 0.81, p < 0.001), volumetric heat capacity (r = 0.93, p < 0.001) and thermal diffusivity (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). Actual evapotranspiration also rose with the increasing SMC (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) and matric water potentials (r = 0.61, p < 0.05). As a consequence of the changes in SMC, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients supported the strong positive relationships of actual evapotranspiration with volumetric heat capacity (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), thermal conductivity (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) and thermal diffusivity (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). Pearson correlation coefficients also supported the strong input of thermal inertia to the actual evapotranspiration (r = 0.88, p < 0.01). During the whole period of observations, actual evapotranspiration varied from 0.05 to 0.59 mm hr(-1), soil thermal conductivity - from 0.225 to -1.056 W m(-1) K-1, volumetric heat capacity - from 1.057 to 1.889 MJ m(-3) K-1, heat diffusivity from 0.189 to 0.559 mm(2) s(-1), and thermal inertia - from 516 to 1412 J m(-2) K-1 s(-0.5).

J	RUAYA, JR; PANEM, CC				RUAYA, JR; PANEM, CC			MT-NATIB, PHILIPPINES - A GEOCHEMICAL MODEL OF A CALDERA-HOSTED GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article								Geochemical investigations have been conducted on the thermal springs within the Mt. Natib caldera, western Luzon, Philippines. The thermal waters are mostly of the SO4-HCO3-Cl and Cl-HCO3 types indicating substantial contributions from condensates and meteoric water. The spatial trend in Cl/B ratios in hot springs is consistent with dominantly vertical permeability and fluid movement. Cation geothermometry indicates subsurface temperatures greater than 200-degrees-C. A chloride-enthalpy plot reveals subsurface dilution of geothermal fluid with conductively heated surface water and points to a reservoir fluid with a chloride content of 5000 mg/kg at a temperature of 170-degrees-C. This temperature estimate is considered to be conservative due to evidence of near-surface low permeability and chemical reequilibration. Finally, a physico-chemical model of the caldera-hosted hydrothermal system at Mt. Natib is presented based on the available data.

This paper reports a study on the use of distributed thermal Smart Loads (SLs) for overvoltage prevention along a LV feeder. The basic principle involves the combined use of electric springs (ESs) and storage-type electric water heaters (EWHs) as distributed smart loads. Through distributed control, these smart loads play the important roles of mitigating reverse power flow problems and maintaining local mains voltage within the specified tolerance. Detailed modeling of the combined ES and EWH including their practical electrical and thermal capacities and constraints is adopted and optional distributed energy storage system (ESS) is also considered in the evaluation. Based on the Sha Lo Bay residential LV network in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, these case studies confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach for overvoltage prevention. The proposed distributed SLs-plus-ESS method is proved to be a cost-effective and environmental friendly way for overvoltage prevention in LV distributed network with high PV penetration.

St. Gorman's Well is a thermal spring in east-central Ireland with a complex and variable temperature profile (maximum of 21.8 degrees C). Geophysical data from a three-dimensional(3D)audio-magnetotelluric(AMT) survey are combined with time-lapse hydrogeological data and information from a previously published hydrochemical analysis to investigate the operation of this intriguing hydrothermal system. Hydrochemical analysis and time-lapse measurements suggest that the thermal waters flow within the fractured limestones of the Carboniferous Dublin Basin at all times but display variability in discharge and temperature. The 3D electrical resistivity model of the subsurface revealed two prominent structures: (1) a NW-aligned faulted contact between two limestone lithologies; and (2) a dissolutionally enhanced, N-aligned, fault of probable Cenozoic age. The intersection of these two structures, which has allowed for karstification of the limestone bedrock, has created conduits facilitating the operation of relatively deep hydrothermal circulation (likely estimated depths between 240 and 1,000 m) within the limestone succession of the Dublin Basin. The results of this study support a hypothesis that the maximum temperature and simultaneous increased discharge observed at St. Gorman's Well each winter is the result of rapid infiltration, heating and recirculation of meteoric waters within a structurally controlled hydrothermal circulation system.

Widespread thermal anomalies, hot springs, and geothermal wells have been reported by previous studies. However, the nature and forming mechanisms of the field remain poorly understood. Element geochemical (ions, rare earth elements) and stable isotopic (D, O) composition of hot springs, geothermal fluids, rivers, and cold springs from different locations of the Xifeng geothermal field were analyzed in this study. The ions studies revealed that most samples featured the Ca-Mg-HCO3 type, except Xifeng hot springs, and which were characterized by the Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 type. Based on quartz geothermometers, the estimated reservoir temperature was 77 degrees C. The results of stable isotopes (D, O) manifest that the Xifeng geothermal system was recharged by meteoric water at an elevation of 1,583 m from SW to NE. The research of rare earth elements (REE) revealed that their accumulation characteristics and obvious positive Eu anomaly were inherited from host feldspar-bearing reservoir dolomites through water-rock interactions. Combined with these observations, geological setting, and previous studies, it was concluded that the formation of the Xifeng geothermal field resulted from recharge, deep circulation, and secondary rising of the meteoric water along the faults. First, meteoric water infiltrated to depth through faults and crack zones. Second, the deep-infiltrated water was heated by radioactive heat, deep heat, and tectonic frictional heat. Finally, as the warmed-up waters underwent considerable deep circulation in the reservoir, it rose again along the main faults, and mixed with groundwater near the surface. Taken together, we suggest that the Xifeng geothermal system should be assigned as a faults-controlling, and deeply circulating meteoric water of low-temperature category.

New sampling and analytical methods have been developed and tested for trace elements. Quantitative measurements were obtained for changes in redox species of S, Fe, As, Sb, and Hg during outflow of thermal waters in which biotic and abiotic reactions play important roles. Fluoride speciation calculations were confirmed with ion-selective electrode measurements. The fate of contaminants, especially As and F, from thermal features in major rivers revealed no significant attenuation during downstream transport. Continuous monitoring for heat flux using year-round conductivity measurements was established. Testing of the "Multiple Equilibria Geothermometer" was achieved with high-quality, long-term data from Ojo Caliente, a continuously flowing hot spring. Yellowstone continues to be an outstanding field laboratory for expanding our knowledge of thermal water-rock interactions.	[Nordstrom, D. Kirk] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [McCleskey, R.

The thermal waters are chemically classified into two groups: NaHCO3 type (<31 degrees C) and NaCl (HCO3, SO4) type (>40 degrees C), both of which have chemical compositions that are distinct from local groundwater (Ca-HCO3 type). delta O-18 and delta D values suggest that the thermal waters originate from meteoric water and they are isotopically fractionated by silicate hydration or H2S exchange. delta S-34 values (+7.0 to +15%) of dissolved sulfate in the thermal waters reflect enrichment in S-34 through kinetically controlled oxidation of magmatic pyrite in the thermal aquifer and mixing with paleo-seawater. On the He-3/He-4 vs. He-4/Ne-20 diagram, the thermal waters plot along a single air mixing line of dominant crustal He, which indicates that the heat source for the thermal waters is non-volcanogenic thermal energy that is generated from the decay of radioactive elements in crustal rocks. Chalcedony geothermometry and thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using the PHREEQC program indicate a reservoir temperature for the immature thermal waters of 54-86 degrees C and 55-83 degrees C, respectively.

Modern thermal (31 to 38 degrees C) springs are found on the floor of the valley between 480 m and 520 m above sea-level. The distribution and nature of travertine facies were determined from natural outcrops. Samples of the travertines and spring water were characterized using a range of geochemical and petrographic methods. Waterfall, slope and pool facies associations consist of various combinations of travertine facies and subordinate detrital facies. Waterfall and slope facies associations of the older deposits occur where the springs emerged onto a hillslope or topographic break. In contrast, the pool facies association developed in depressions or flat areas that were fed by thermal springs. The youngest generation (1.85 ka) precipitated at lower elevations than the older ones (147 to 153 ka). Stable carbon and oxygen isotope values of the Aksaz travertines range between +4.3 parts per thousand and +6.3 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and -12.6 parts per thousand and -7.2 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite), respectively. The high delta C-13 values suggest that the thermal waters were charged with isotopically heavy CO2 of deep origin. Based on palaeotemperature calculations, the temperatures of the palaeosprings are slightly higher (up to 44 degrees C) than the present equivalents, but sometimes the temperature is lower, probably due to mixing with the stream water. Although the thermal waters occasionally are impeded by fluvial activity, travertine precipitation occurs in the protected parts of the Aksaz Stream valley. This contribution highlights the applicability of the fluvial facies model for tufa for the interpretation of travertine deposits worldwide.

There is growing concern that climate change will result in stream warming due to rising air temperatures, decreased shading in forested areas due to wildfires, and changes in streamflow. Groundwater plays an important role in controlling stream temperatures in mountain headwaters, where it makes up a considerable portion of discharge. This study investigated the controls on the thermal regime of a headwater stream, and the surrounding groundwater processes, in a catchment on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Groundwater discharge to the headwater spring is partially sourced by a seasonal lake. Spring, stream and lake temperature, water level, discharge and chemistry data were used to build a conceptual model of the system. Meteorological data was used to set up a stream temperature model. This study presents a unique example of an indirectly lake-headed stream, that is, a lake that only has transient subsurface hydrologic connections to the stream and no surface connections. The interaction of groundwater and lake water, and the subsurface connectivity between the lake and the headwater spring determine the resulting stream temperature. Radiation dominated the non-advective fluxes in the stream energy balance. Sensible and latent heat fluxes play a secondary role, but their effects generally cancel out. During snowfall events, the latent heat associated with melting of direct snowfall onto the water surface was responsible for rapid stream cooling. An increase in advective inputs from groundwater and hillslope pathways did not result in observed cooling of stream water during rainfall events. The results from this study will assist water resource and fisheries managers in adapting to stream temperature changes under a warming climate.

L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) strains have been isolated from several patients, but the source of contamination was not identified despite the presence of different Lp1 in water samples of the three natural springs feeding the spa at this period. Results: Our strategy was to investigate L. pneumophila (Lp) strains from natural biofilms developed in a sulphur-rich warm spring of this contaminated site. Biofilm analysis revealed the presence of three Lp serogroups (Lp1, Lp10 and Lp12). Surprisingly, Lp10 and Lp12 were not reported in the previous described studies from water samples. Besides, the new seven Lp1 we isolated exhibit a high molecular diversity and have been differentiated in five classes according to their DNA genome patterns obtained by PFGE and mip sequences. It must be noted that these DNA patterns are original and unknown in databases. Interestingly, the 27 Lp environmental strains we isolated display a higher cytotoxicity and virulence towards the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii than those of known Lp1 epidemic strains. Conclusion: The characteristics of Legionella pneumophila Lp1 strains isolated from the warm spring are in agreement with their presence in biofilms and their probable long-term persistence in this ecosystem.

J	Battistel, M; Hurwitz, S; Evans, WC; Barbieri, M				Battistel, Maria; Hurwitz, Shaul; Evans, William C.; Barbieri, Maurizio			The chemistry and isotopic composition of waters in the low-enthalpy geothermal system of Cimino-Vico Volcanic District, Italy	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Low-enthalpy geothermal system; Fluid geochemistry; Boron isotopes; Strontium isotopes; Central Italy	NATURAL HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; THERMAL WATERS; GEOLOGICAL-MATERIALS; BORON; GEOCHEMISTRY; AQUIFERS; AREA; GROUNDWATER; STRONTIUM; TUSCANY	Geothermal energy exploration is based in part on interpretation of the chemistry, temperature, and discharge rate of thermal springs. Here we present the major element chemistry and the delta D, delta O-18 Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta B-11 isotopic ratio of groundwater from the low-enthalpy geothermal system near the city of Viterbo in the Cimino-Vico volcanic district of west-Central Italy. The geothermal system hosts many thermal springs and gas vents, but the resource is still unexploited. Water chemistry is controlled by mixing between low salinity,HCO3-rich fresh waters (<24.2 degrees C) flowing in shallow volcanic rocks and SO4-rich thermal waters (253 degrees C to 62.2 degrees C) ascending from deep, high permeability Mesozoic limestones. The (equivalent) SO4/Cl (0.01-0.02), Na/Cl (2.82-5.83) and B/Cl ratios (0.02-0.38) of thermal waters differs from the ratios in other geothermal systems from Central Italy, probably implying a lack of hydraulic continuity across the region. The delta O-18 (-6.6 parts per thousand to 5.9 parts per thousand) and 8D (-40.60 parts per thousand to 36.30 parts per thousand) isotopic composition of spring water suggest that the recharge area for the geothermal system is the summit region of Mount Cimino. The strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) of thermal waters (0.70797-0.70805) are consistent with dissolution of the Mesozoic evaporite-carbonate units that constitute the reservoir, and the ratios of cold fresh waters mainly reflect shallow circulation through the volcanic cover and some minor admixture (<10%) of thermal water as well. The boron isotopic composition (delta B-11) of fresh waters (-5.00 and 6.12 parts per thousand) is similar to that of the volcanic cover, but the delta B-11 of thermal waters (-8.37 parts per thousand to -4.12 parts per thousand) is a mismatch for the Mesozoic reservoir rocks and instead reflects dissolution of secondary boron minerals during fluid ascent through flysch units that overlie the reservoir. A slow and tortuous ascent enhances extraction of boron but also promotes conductive cooling, partially masking the heat present in the reservoir. Overall data from this study is consistent with previous studies that concluded that the geothermal system has a large energy potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whole rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios throughout the basin range between 0.7054 and 0.7281. Ratios in surface water samples differ greatly between runoff from the mainly granitic Sierra (0.7094-0.7097) and runoff from the volcanic regions (0.7054-0.7064). The ratio in Mono Lake water (0.7096) is similar to the ratios of streams from the Sierra Nevada. Springs close to the western shoreline have more radiogenic Sr ratios (0.7092-0.7100), while those on the east side have ratios (0.7081-0.7088) indicative of a mixture of water from the volcanic terrain and Mono Lake. Thermal springs at the south side of the lake have Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7081-0.7089 and might originate in Paleozoic limestones at depth.

The word "Alfama" probably comes from the Arabic "Al-Hamma," which means "hot spring." This historical importance is revealed through the diversified water usage, such as ship water supply during the Portuguese marine expansion period from the fifteenth century on, or even the way of living of the zone, materialized not only by the existence of laundrywomen in the area but also with several commercial and daily activities related with the water. Some of these springs had temperatures above 20 degrees C and significant therapeutic properties, which made them object of an intensive search and usage by local population and surrounding areas. Water from these springs, meanwhile totally sealed and abandoned more than 40 years ago, was qualified as "mineral water" by the authorities and was therefore used in several public baths, known as "Alcacarias," by the end of the nineteenth century. These "Alcacarias" were used by the Lisbon population for decades and were also very influent in the city living. The appearance of the "Fonte das Ratas" spring, in the 1960s, has also contributed to keep the memory of the Alfama springs alive up to today, mostly to local inhabitants. Recently, research work comprising geological, hydrochemical, and geophysical works was conducted in the area to achieve a better understanding of the hydrogeological conceptual model of the Alfama thermal springs (distribution and characteristics, flowpaths, mixing processes, etc.) and their relation with the local tectonic framework. This paper shows, in a simplified way, the geographical spring location based on historical documents and archeological data, as well as the geological and hydrogeological characteristics that constrain the area. The paper also shows the way these waters were exploited for several centuries, leading to the concept that the real heritage of the Alfama district lies underground, in groundwater that can no longer be seen by the population or its visitors. Some considerations are also made on possible future uses of these waters, once the characteristics that made them famous are confirmed nowadays.

In this work, radon and radium activity concentrations of thermal and bottled mineral waters, originating from different regions of Hungary, were studied by different radioanalytical methods. It was found that the thermal springs, which supply the world famous baths of Budapest along the right riverside of the Danube, have high Rn-222 and Ra-226 activity concentration: up to about 100 and 1 kBq m(-3), respectively. The radium content of some investigated geothermal waters found in the NE region of the Great Hungarian Plain is even higher: up to several kBq m(-3). The Ra-226 content of bottled mineral waters, commercially available in Hungary, was determined by gamma-spectrometric method, applying radiochemical separation. The highest value exceeded 2 kBq m(-3) in the case of the Apenta mineral water, which is a popular brand in Hungary, as well as in Europe and North America. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When Fathead Minnows were exposed to temperature treatments of 12, 16, or 20 A degrees C during the winter, spawning occurred at 16 and 20 A degrees C but not 12 A degrees C. Eggs were deposited over 9 weeks before winter spawning ceased. Fathead Minnows from the three winter temperature treatments were then exposed to a simulated spring transition. Spawning occurred at all three temperature treatments during the spring, but fish from the 16A degrees and 20 A degrees C treatment had delayed egg production indicating a latent effect of warm winter temperatures on spring spawning. mRNA analysis of the egg yolk protein vitellogenin showed elevated expression in female Fathead Minnows at 16 and 20 A degrees C during winter spawning that decreased after winter spawning ceased, whereas Fathead Minnows at 12 A degrees C maintained comparatively low expression during winter. Johnny Darters were exposed to 4 A degrees C to represent winter temperatures in the absence of thermal inputs, and 12, 16, and 20 A degrees C to represent varying degrees of winter thermal pollution. Johnny Darters spawned during winter at 12, 16, and 20 A degrees C but not at 4 A degrees C. Johnny Darters at 4 A degrees C subsequently spawned following a simulated spring period while those at 12, 16, and 20 A degrees C did not. Our results indicate elevated winter water temperatures common in effluent-dominated streams can promote out-of-season spawning and that vitellogenin expression is a useful indicator of spawning readiness for fish exposed to elevated winter temperatures.

Constraints on evolution and residence time of geothermal water in granitic rocks at Grimsel (Switzerland)	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL			geothermal water; groundwater mixing; radiogenic isotopes; atmospheric H-3 and C-14; crystalline rocks		Thermal spring water (17-28 degrees C) occurring in crystalline rocks at the Grimsel area, Switzerland, represents a mixture of an old geothermal component with a surface-derived, young cold water component. Comparison of chemical and isotope data of cold and thermal spring water collected in 1991/92 and 2014/15 allows deciphering the residence time and evolution of the geothermal component. Accounting for changes in atmospheric input for d(18)O, d(2)H, H-3 and C-14, a meteoric origin from similar moisture source(s) for the cold and geothermal component is proposed, a H-3-PF model age of about 7 years for the cold component and infiltration of the geothermal component before 30 ka during an interglacial cycle. Deep circulation of the geothermal component is inferred from water temperatures of 110-120 degrees C and the uptake of geogenic CO2 and/or CH4. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detection of antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria in the sediment and water of Ma'in thermal springs (Jordan)	GERMS			English	Article						Actinobacteria; antibiotics; Ma'in thermal springs; Jordan		Introduction Detection of new Actinobacteria is significant to discover new antibiotics because development of new antibiotics is connected to the characterization of novel bacterial taxa. This study has focused on the identification and isolation of antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria from the sediment and the water of Ma'in thermal springs (48-59 degrees C) situated in the center area of Jordan. Methods Samples of sediment and water were transferred to glucose yeast malt agar medium and Actinobacteria were cultivated, isolated and identified according to scanning electron microscopy and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Antibacterial activities of the isolates were then tested against different test bacteria by agar well diffusion method. Results Three different species of Actinobacteria were isolated (M1.1, M2.2, M3.2) from sediment samples. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, isolate M1.1 was found to have only 90% identity percentage with Nocardiopsis sp., however, isolates M2.2 and M3.2 were found to be closely related Streptomyces sp. (97%) and Nocardioides luteus (99%), respectively. The antibacterial activity showed that strain M1.1 is active against P. aeruginosa ATCC 2785 (inhibition zone, 9 mm). Strain M2-2 was found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 29213 (12 mm), B. cereusATCC 11778 (11 mm), and E coliATCC 25922 (9 mm). In respect to strain M3.2, it was found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 29213 (14 mm) and B. cereus ATCC 11778 (9 mm). There were no actinobacterial isolates obtained from water samples despite their significant diversity revealed by our previous metagenomic analysis, which showed the presence of 13 different species dominated by Arthrobacter (an Actinobacterium belonging to family Actinomycetales). Conclusion There were 17 different Actinobacteria that could be detected in Ma'in thermal springs (13 unculturable species and 3 culturable species). The culturable Actinobacteria were found to have some antimicrobial activity. Further chemical analysis of the bioactive compounds is recommended.

A combined geochemical and isotopic study of the fluids discharged from the Montecatini thermal system (NW Tuscany, Italy)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							NORTHERN APENNINES; CHEMICAL GEOTHERMOMETRY; EXTENSIONAL TECTONICS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; SECCHIA VALLEY; CARBON; WATER; METHANE	The thermo-mineral fluids discharges of Montecatini Terme (Northern Apennines, Tuscany, Italy) have been exploited since the Roman times and despite the fact that this thermal complex is one of the biggest in Europe, the most recent geochemical investigations were published almost 40 years ago. To fill this gap, in this paper a detailed geochemical and isotopic investigation on the main thermal springs and wells from the Montecatini thermal system (MTS) is presented. The chemical and isotopic features of the Montecatini waters suggested that they are mainly controlled by water-rock interaction processes between meteoric water, permeating at depth from the surrounding reliefs (up to 800 m a.s.l.), and the Triassic evaporites (Burano Formation) belonging to the Tuscan sedimentary series. The local stratigraphic and tectonic framework favors an efficient recharge of the hydrothermal reservoir by the meteoric precipitation from a large catchment area and this aspect plays a fundamental role for the longevity of the Montecatini thermal spas, notwithstanding the huge amount of thermal water exploited. The H-3 values indicated that the thermal waters are likely related to a relatively long (>50 years) fluid circulation pattern. Approaching the surface, thermal and saline waters mix with cold and low TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) waters hosted in short, shallow aquifer(s), whose chemistry is dictated by the interaction of rain waters with silico-clastic rocks of low solubility. Geothermometric estimations in the F -SO42 -HCO3 system suggested the occurrence of a main fluid reservoir at T >= 80-95 degrees C and PCO2 similar to 0.5 bars. Such CO2 pressure is consistent with values estimated for other thermal springs from central-southern Tuscany, being CO2 basically supplied by a deep source. Nevertheless, delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-TDIC values were lower than those expected for a mantle/thermometamorphic CO2 source. This can be explained by: (i) isotopic fractionation occurring during calcite precipitation and/or (ii) mixing with biogenically derived gases, occurring at relatively shallow depth.

We measured body temperature, metabolic rate and evaporative water loss, and calculated wet thermal conductance, for bats exposed to air temperatures ranging from 0 to 40degreesC for periods of 2-5h. Pregnant females maintained normothermic body temperatures (35.7+/-0.7degreesC; mean +/- S.E.M.) independent of air temperature. In contrast, males became torpid during the majority (68%) of exposures to air temperatures <25degreesC. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) ranged between approximately 30degreesC and 34degreesC in both sexes and, within the TNZ, females had lower mass-specific metabolic rates (6.1+/-0.2 mW g(-1)) than males (9.0+/-0.9 mW g(-1)). Wet thermal conductance values in torpid bats (0.7+/-0.5 mW g(-1) deg.(-1)) were lower than those of normothermic individuals (1.1+/-0.3 mW g(-1) deg.(-1)). Mass-specific rates of evaporative water loss in males were consistently higher than in females at most air temperatures and rates of water loss in torpid bats were 63+/-6% of normothermic values. These results suggest that male and pregnant female L. cinereus employ different thermoregulatory strategies during their spring migration. Females defend normothermic body temperatures, presumably to expedite embryonic growth, while males use torpor, presumably to minimize energy and water deficits. These variable thermoregulatory strategies may reflect continental differences in the summer distribution of the sexes.

Results compare favorably with previously obtained data for temperature distributions around the lake during midsummer 2007. During the spring months, when experimental data is not available, the model predicts strong and rapid variations in the water temperature, which correlate well with significant storms on the lake. A heat balance shows that the largest components of heat fluxes into and out of the lake are due to short wave solar and evaporative cooling, respectively. Both numerical and experimental results also indicate that, due to the shallow nature of the lake and occurrence of significant wind events, thermal stratification is never achieved.

Meteoric waters infiltrate the more permeable exposed rocks (carbonates and/or volcanites) and percolate down into two main aquifers. One is deep and located in Mesozoic anhydritic-carbonate formations, and is the regional geothermal reservoir that feeds springs that emerge at the margins of the carbonate series (either exposed or barely covered); its waters display typical bicarbonate-sulfate alkaline earth composition. The other aquifer(s) is shallower, consisting of waters that circulate primarily in volcanic deposits. The chemical characteristics of these shallow waters are heavily influenced by lithology and by a gas phase, mainly CO2, originating at depth. Temperature estimates obtained with SiO2 and gas geothermometers, which seem to be the most reliable under these conditions, indicate the widespread occurrence of deep fluids at temperatures higher than 110-degrees-C under the area covered by the Sabatini volcanites. In some areas (Manziana, Trevignano, Nepi, and Cesano) the subsurface waters reach temperatures within the range characteristic of medium to high enthalpy systems (120-160-degrees-C).

We examined interannual surface and deep water temperature change and stratification phenology in a long-term, weekly data set (1985-2017) from a dimictic lake in New York State, USA. We developed a metric, called mixing action, to capture multiple facets about the stratified period. We found warming in surface waters and cooling in deep water. Surface warming was positively correlated with air temperature. Deep water cooling was positively correlated with spring mixing period length and deep water spring temperature, indicating a lag effect. Mixing action was correlated with global temperature anomaly and spring North Atlantic Oscillation index. With increasing summer stratification strength and length, dimictic lakes like Mohonk may continue shifting toward monomictic mixing regimes with increasing summer hypolimnetic anoxia and changing lake biogeochemistry, productivity, and habitat for aquatic organisms.

J	Gargini, A; Stefani, A; Vannini, S				Gargini, Alessandro; Stefani, Alessandro; Vannini, Stefano			The groundwater flow system of Terme Alte (Alto Reno Terme, Bologna, Italy).	ACQUE SOTTERRANEE-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER			Italian	Article						Porretta Terme; hydrogeology; thermal water; hydrodynamic parametrization; aquifer		The thermal field of Porretta Terme, located in the Alto Reno Terme municipality (Bologna), has always raised interest for its peculiar waters since ancient times. Indeed, the use of the springs dates back to the I-II century A.D. and perhaps even in the Etruscan period. Porretta's thermal tradition has developed over the centuries. First regulation, issued in 1936, allowed to cultivate the mineral deposit and its natural gas in a 740 000 acres wide land. The thermal waters, a public good, are indeed ruled by specific laws which control their use through a grant where the Public Authority makes the licensee, usually a private, follow a series of accomplishments aimed at not damaging the quantitative and qualitative characteristics (R.D. July 29, 1927 n. 1443). Fourteen thermo- mineral springs out of the nineteen located in the given land are currently exploited. They are divided into two groups, which differentiate either for the chemical properties of the waters and their topographic location. The first group of springs, called salt-bromoiodic, with higher salinity and temperature, is located in the upper part of Porretta along the Rio Maggiore, a tributary on the left bank of the Reno River. This is the portion of the deposit that has been studied. The second group of springs, called sulphurous, characterized by lower temperatures and salinity, is located south-east Porretta on the left side of the Reno River. These thermo-mineral water resources appear to be very worthy and need particular care and protection. By using the results of past research, the essential bibliography of which has been edited in the end- notes, the aim was to develop the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer that feeds the thermo-mineral sources, identify and understand the conceptual model of the groundwater circulation system, also detecting the interference between the different sources in the area examined. This type of research, which is usually applied to aquifers in sedimentary and granular soils, can be considered original. Indeed, an exhaustive hydrodynamic parameterization of a fractured thermal aquifer system such as that of Porretta has never been conducted. The collection of observational data on the hydrological regime and on the chemical composition of hot waters during the six months of field surveys, which confirmed the substantial constancy of the values over time, was also remarkable.

Hydrochemical signatures of deep groundwater circulation in a part of the Himalayan foreland basin	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Review						Hydrochemistry; Compressive stress; Geothermal water	FLUID PRESSURES; NORTHWEST PAKISTAN; NORTHERN PAKISTAN; NATURAL-WATERS; LATE PALEOCENE; WEST-BENGAL; HINDU-KUSH; INDIA; FLOW; TEMPERATURES	Groundwater samples were analyzed from 71 springs and wells as part of a larger study in a region of compressional tectonic regime. The study site covers the Peshawar basin and surroundings in the Himalayan foreland of Pakistan. The northern portion is mountainous and the water table is discontinuous in different intermontane valleys, with abundant springs (with normal and anomalous temperatures and composition). The southern part is divided into isolated basins with a number of drilled ("deep'') and dug ("shallow'') wells. Hydrochemical signatures of elevated strontium (Sr), SiO2, boron (B)-and the geo-thermometric signatures-all indicate a deep circulation of the emerging groundwater. Moreover, for several of the sample sites, water chemical compositions, measured spring and water well temperatures, and reservoir temperatures calculated for spring waters, all point to origin from deep horizons within the basin. Remarkable proximity of all the thermal and hydrochemical anomalies to major faults suggests that the waters ascended along these faults from greater depths. The area is a natural western extension of the Himalayan Geothermal Belt described in earlier literature for the eastern and central Himalayas.

The Lake Abhe geothermal system occurs within a rift basin filled with Pliocene-Quaternary volcanic (mainly basalt) and lacustrine sediments. The thermal water in Lake Abhe geothermal field discharges as hot springs at the bottom of hydrothermal carbonate chimneys distributed along the main faults. Hot springs of Lake Abhe geothermal field as well as ground- and surface waters were sampled and major elements, trace elements, and isotopic (O-18/O-16, H-2/H-1, H-3, S-34/S-32, Sr-82/Sr-86) compositions were analyzed. Hydrochemical features of the hot springs are dissimilar from those of warm waters: the former are mainly Na-Cl dominated whereas the latter were mostly Na-HCO3-Cl-SO4 and Na-HCO3-Cl. The isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen in dissolved sulfates suggests equilibrium with anhydrite as the major source of sulfates in the thermal waters. Chemical (mainly Na/K and SiO2), isotope (bisulfate- and anhydrite-water), and multiple mineral equilibrium approaches were applied to estimate the reservoir temperature of the hot springs in the Lake Abhe geothermal field. These different geothermometric approaches estimated a temperature range of the deep geothermal reservoir of 120-160 degrees C. In spite of the relatively wide range, the three different approaches led to a same mean of about 135 degrees C. The hot spring and warm borehole waters from the southwestern part of the Republic of Djibouti showed a possible mixing with hydrothermal waters from the local rift. The negligible tritium content and the low deuterium values (delta H-2 < -10 parts per thousand) suggest a deeper circulation and an old age for geothermal water, in comparison with surface waters and the local aquifers recharged by modem precipitations (delta H-2 > -10 parts per thousand).

The composition and uses of these spring waters may not allow standard disinfection in pools, representing a challenge for hygiene management. Several safety and quality procedures were proposed, but a systematic approach is still needed. Here, we focus on alternative strategies to provide hints for developing a sustainable Water Safety Plan, based on intrinsic water properties and photocatalytic materials. The antimicrobial activity of four different SPA waters with high mineral content and one drinkable spring water with a low mineral content, was assessed and then tested for the additional bactericidal activity of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterials and/or light exposure at different wavelengths (200-635 nm). A native antibacterial activity was observed in all high mineral content waters, with a CFU reduction of 75-80%. The bactericidal action of TiO2 showed an additional incremental effect, with a reduction of over 99% within 2-5 h. Interestingly, the antibacterial photocatalytic effect was detected also in the visible light range, with a possible pick around 450-455 nm, blue-light. Based on observed results, we propose a model for developing a water safety plan, considering water properties and bather exposure. This candidate approach is personalized on water composition and pool use, trying to avoid chemical disinfectants. Photocatalytic nanotechnologies represent one of the promising alternative treatments and can provide novel perspectives for a sustainable managing of natural SPA water hygiene.

The Ush-Beldir territory has about 10 thermal springs and 4 exploration wells used for treatment and prevention of diseases. Hydrological and hydrochemical features of the thermal groundwaters are considered. The studied waters are thermal (T=50-83 degrees C), alkaline (pH=9.3-10), low mineralized (TDS<370 mg/L) Na HCO3 waters with a high content of SiO2 (up to 125 mg/L) and F (up to 14 mg/L). The correlation of F- with SiO2, HCO3-, Cl-, Na+ as well as the calculation of saturation indices of minerals, allows one plausible solute source for these thermal waters, viz. the dissolution of rock-forming aluminosilicates, most likely plagioclase, gabbro and/or amphiboles in shales.

In total, twenty six different cyanoprokaryotes were identified. Based on our observations, the Chatra hot spring of Jharkhand area was found to be rich in cyanobacterial diversity where eight different taxa were reported. Among the recorded taxa, Geitlerinema amphibium, Komvophoron cf. schmidlei, K. jovis andLeptolyngbya granulifera are rare cyanobacterial species with a limited geographical distribution inhabiting the Indian springs based on the previous studies and available literature on the hot springs of India. The correlation of the cyanobacterial species identified and water parameters was studied by redundancy analysis (RDA) under CANOCO 5.0. Moreover, sampling stations were added in the RDA analysis. As a result of the RDA, the total variation was 23,83333, and it is seen that the first two axes explain 47.39% of the total variance. RDA analysis results showed that values of pH, sulfate, and sodium ions were the most effective water factors affecting the distribution of the cyanobacterial taxa identified. Though the water temperature is an important factor controlling the distribution of cyanobacterial taxa inhabiting the thermal water habitats, it was not among the most important abiotic drivers according to the RDA analysis in this work.

This paper discusses the certainty of the nature, type, and origin of the hot springs found in the Rawadanau Basin, Indonesia. The approach in this study is to use hydro-chemical characteristics and stable isotopes. Besides measuring field data, laboratory analyzes were also carried out - hydrogeochemical analysis including cations and anions and stable isotopes analyses. Twenty-one hot springs have been reported. The temperature varied from 31.2 to 54.6 degrees C; the pH was 6.8 and 7.7, and EC was between 1099 and 4460 mu S/cm. There are three water types of Mg-Ca-HCO3-Cl, Mg-CaHCO3 in the northern, and Na-Cl in the southern. Chloro-alkaline indices implied that ion exchange and reverse ion exchange influenced the hydrogeochemistry of hot springs. The 818O and 82H values varied between -8.6 to -4.6 parts per thousand (818O) and from -57.0 to -32.4 parts per thousand (82H), lay to the local meteoric water line, indicating that the thermal waters are meteoric local in origin and originated from precipitation. The hot springs in the study area originate from meteoric water and interact with geothermal fluids from confined aquifers that flow to the surface through fractures and faults. The reservoir temperature approach 150 degrees C is based on chalcedony; and the reservoir depth is about 1.1 km.	[Hartanto, Priyo; Alam, Boy Yoseph C. S. S. Syah; Ismawan, Ismawan; Iskandarsyah, T.

Hydrogeology of thermal waters in Viterbo area, central Italy	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						thermal conditions; conceptual models; hydrochemistry; Viterbo; central Italy	GROUNDWATER VELOCITY; TEMPERATURE; GEOTHERMOMETRY; SPRINGS; REGION; CIMINO; NORTH	A conceptual hydrogeological model of the Viterbo thermal area (central Italy) has been developed. Though numerous studies have been conducted on its geological, geochemical and geothermal features, there is no generalized picture de. ning the origin and yield of the hydrothermal system. These latter aspects have therefore become the objectives of this research, which is based on new hydrogeological and geochemical investigations. The geological setting results in the coexistence of overlapped interacting aquifers. The shallow volcanic aquifer, characterized by fresh waters, is fed from the area around the Cimini Mountains and is limited at its base by the semiconfining marly-calcareous-arenaceous complex and low-permeability clays. To the west of Viterbo, vertical upflows of thermal waters of the sulphate-chloride-alkaline-earth type with higher gas contents, are due to the locally uplifted carbonate reservoir, the reduced thickness of the semiconfining layer and the high local geothermal gradient. The hot waters (30-60 degrees C) are the result of deep circulation within the carbonate rocks (0.5-1.8 km) and have the same recharge area as the volcanic aquifer. The upward flow in the Viterbo thermal area is at least 0.1 m(3)/s. This flow feeds springs and deep wells, also recharging the volcanic aquifer from below.

At present, the number of spas has decreased notably, although some of them have been restored for aesthetic reasons. From 1970 onwards hydrogeothermic energy started to be used. There are some boreholes and small facilities at several places in Spain, mostly on the Mediterranean coast and near Madrid. The hydrochemistry of spanish thermal groundwaters is directly related to the geological nature of granite and limestones where most important springs are located.

The thermal model is developed to assess the photobioreactor's thermal profile and evaporative water loss rate for a range of environmental parameters, including ambient air temperature, solar irradiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. First, a week-long simulation of the system has been performed using environmental data for Memphis, TN, on a typical week during the spring, summer, fall, and winter. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of each weather parameter on the temperature and evaporative loss rate of the photobioreactor. The range of the daily algae temperature variation was observed to be 12.2 degrees C, 13.2 degrees C, 11.7 degrees C, and 8.2 degrees C in the spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. Furthermore, without active cooling, the characteristic evaporative water loss from the system is approximately 6.0 L/m(2) day, 7.3 L/m(2) day, 3.4 L/m(2) day, and 1.0 L/m(2) day in the spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively.

Hydrogeochemistry, isotopes and geothermometry of Ixtapan de la Sal-Tonatico hot springs, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hot springs; Hydrogeochemistry; Geothermometry; Stable isotopes; Mixing; Mexico	THERMAL WATERS; CHEMICAL GEOTHERMOMETRY; MINERAL EQUILIBRIA; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; MIXING PROCESSES; SYSTEMS; AREA; GEOCHEMISTRY; REGION; FIELD	The Ixtapan de la Sal-Tonatico hot springs are located in the geological setting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, on the border of the Morelos-Guerrero Basin, which is carbonated region with limestone and silicic rocks. The temperature, electrical conductivity and pH of the thermal waters are 25.7-37.2 degrees C, 9520-13,920 mu S/cm and 5.90-6.88, respectively. The hydrochemical family is NaCl (Cl- mean concentration of 2198 mg/L and Na+ mean concentration of 1396 mg/L). The minor and trace elements that are notable for their high concentrations are B (19.69-23.58 mg/L), Li (6.09-8.06 mg/L), Sr (4.80-6.18 mg/L) and As (0.30-1.97 mg/L). Isotope data (delta O-18, delta H-2) show delta O-18 enrichment of the thermal waters, which may be a result of isotopic exchange with the host rock at high temperatures, although the value was very small, which may be due to mixing with groundwater near the surface. The water samples were oversaturated with calcite, dolomite and quartz, verified in the field by the presence of precipitated rocks (travertines). The samples were undersaturated with chalcedony, silica gel, cristobalite, celestite and strontianite. Several chemical geothermometers and the results from multicomponent equilibrium suggest a reservoir temperature between 90 and 130 degrees C. Meanwhile, a temperature of 129 degrees C was estimated with the Cl-enthalpy mixing model. According to the conceptual model of the functioning of this system, considering that flow is characterized by the heating of water at deep zones due to the high geothermal gradient caused by recent tectonic activity. This water rises to the surface through fractures and faults. As it rises, thermal water mixes in different proportions with Ca-HCO3 groundwater.	[Martinez-Florentino, A. K.; Esteller, M.

We collected 56 samples to determine the chemical, stable isotope, C-14 and tritium content of the waters. We found large stable isotope variations in precipitation collected at different altitudes, whereas the geothermal waters are largely homogeneous and seasonally independent. Data on springs and rivers, the local meteoric water line and recharge area were obtained. Three groups of groundwater were identified by age - modern from natural springs, old from mines and very old from the Vranjska Banja. Because the initial C-14 activity of infiltrated waters from the recharge area is unknown, the age of thermal waters can only be inferred, from HCO3-, C-14 and H-3 content, to be 10,000 to 28,000 years old.

MOLLUSK POPULATION OF A SUBARCTIC HYDROTHERMAL ECOSYSTEM IN WINTER	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL			Russian	Article							SYSTEMS	The structure of the mollusk population in a subarctic hydrothermal ecosystem in winter was studied from the example of Pymvashor area (Bolshezemelskaya tundra). Specific communities of the gastropod type with the simplified structure and low specific diversity against the high number of mollusks were revealed. The certain set of species dominating under specific environmental conditions (Lymnaea ovata, L. lagotis and L. fontinalis) of the territory studied is formed. The preservation of the activity of mollusks in hydroterms is characteristic at extremely low air temperatures (up to - 38 degrees C). They inhabit very limited space and are mainly restricted to algal and moss mats expanding in hot water. In the thermal springs studied, the sizes of Lymnaeidae were reduced as compared to those of other regions. In hydrothermal ecosystems of Northern Eurasia (the Cisurals, Lake Baikal, Kamchatka, and Chukotka), similar communities consisting of pulmonary mollusks of the families Lymnaeidae and Planorbidae are formed. The density and biomass of mollusk settlements in the thermal springs were very higher than those in usual streams of the tundra zone. In winter, mollusks of the thermal springs present the basic food resource for fishes feeding on benthos in the stream taking waters of hydrotherms.	[Bespalaya, Yu V.; Bolotov, I. N.; Usacheva, O.

Thermal bar progression rates were compared with two analytical models; both produced overestimates during the early part of the thermal bar and underestimates during the late spring. In a zone between the shore and the thermal bar, currents were influenced by the local wind stress and flowed in a counter-clockwise direction. The mean cross-shore flows in the nearshore zone were reduced during the thermal bar period. The alongshore horizontal exchange coefficients were higher than cross-shore exchange coefficients. During the thermal bar period, the magnitude of both alongshore and cross-shore exchange coefficients decreased when the bar was still within middepth (<40 m); when it was further offshore, the thermal bar did not have any significant effect on alongshore exchange coefficients, but cross-shore exchanges decreased marginally. The vertical exchange coefficients were high in the water column because of convective mixing during the thermal bar period. During the evolution of spring thermal bar, the vertical mixing decreased considerably in the nearshore regions under stable stratification, whereas the high vertical mixing levels continued in the offshore region for a longer period.

Owing to the thermal springs nourishing the lake, it has a relatively rapid water turnover. In spring 2011 a comprehensive embankment reconstruction was performed to preserve the water supply of the surrounding wetland habitats. The physical and chemical parameters as well as the planktonic microbial communities were studied with special respect to the effect of the disturbance of the water of Lake Heviz. According to the abiotic components, both temporal and spatial differences were revealed with the exception of autumn samples. The reconstruction resulted in a short term but dramatic alteration of the total planktonic bacterial and cyanobacterial community structures as revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. In addition, greater seasonal than spatial differences of bacterial communities were also observed. Planktonic bacterial community composition of Lake Heviz included mainly typical freshwater species within phylum Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and class Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria. Most of them were aerobic or facultative anaerobic heterotrophic but chemolitotrophic (e.g. Thiobacillus) or photolithotrophic (e.g. Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi) autotrophic microbes were also identified.

In this paper, some of the most important irreversible processes (cooling, mixing and CO(2) exchange) are studied and their effects quantified by combining classical geochemical calculations and geochemical modelling. This methodology is applied to an alkaline thermal water system developed in crystalline rocks (the Caldas de Boi groundwater system, NE Spain) analogous to the deep geological environments expected for nuclear waste storage. One of the most remarkable results obtained in this study is related to the high pH-buffering capacity exhibited by these alkaline-thermal waters during the mixing processes, with colder and shallower waters, taking place during the uprising of the hot waters from the deep reservoir. Even for high mixing proportions of cold water (up to 60%), the final pH remains as alkaline as in the thermal and deep end member, although the rest of the physicochemical parameters (including temperature) change consistently with mixing. Another important secondary pH-determining process detected in this study is the conductive cooling of the thermal waters suffered during their rise to surface conditions, which is clearly responsible for a pH increase which enhances the typical alkaline character of these waters. Finally, the existence of external inputs of edaphic or biogenic CO(2) to the groundwater system, producing a pH decrease in some of the springs, has been proven to play a key role in their behaviour and evolution.

J	Morey, SL; O'Brien, JJ				Morey, SL; O'Brien, JJ			The spring transition from horizontal to vertical thermal stratification on a midlatitude continental shelf	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						continental shelf; stratification; Mixed Layer Dynamics; Coastal Ocean Modeling; West Florida Shelf	MIDDLE ATLANTIC BIGHT; FLUX	[1] The spring transition from wintertime horizontal thermal stratification to the summertime vertically stratified state on a wide, sloping midlatitude continental shelf is investigated. The sigma z-level model (SZM), a new three-dimensional primitive equation numerical ocean model employing a hybrid sigma coordinate and z-level coordinate in the vertical, simulates the continental shelf region. A simple analytical model to describe the heating rate of a well-mixed water column is applied to the problem to illustrate the importance of bottom slope in determining the evolution of the horizontal thermal stratification. The applicability of this simple model to continental shelf dynamics forced by realistic surface fluxes is studied with a "pseudo'' two-dimensional (x-z) form of the SZM forced with daily heat flux and wind stress records from the West Florida Shelf. A term-by-term analysis of the depth-averaged time-integrated temperature equation quantifies the contribution of each physical process to the evolution of the horizontal temperature field. The simple model used to describe the heating rate of a homogeneous water column appears as the dominant balance in the integrated temperature equation. Cross-shelf temperature advection associated with upwelling and downwelling alters the horizontal depth-integrated temperature over the shelf predicted by the simple model. Two processes describe the spring transition. The erosion of the wintertime horizontal thermal gradient occurs on a timescale of a few months when the water column is being heated and mixed periodically. The second process is the formation of the seasonal thermocline following the last strong mixing event. This occurs on a timescale of less than a week under a stabilizing heat flux and light winds completing the spring transition from horizontal to vertical thermal stratification.

The geogas emanates via mineral springs, water mofettes, or dry mofettes. It is assumed that the emerging gas influences the temperature of the spring or mofette water, respectively and the surface temperature of the soil at and around the dry gas vents. This causes a thermal anomaly in comparison to the close vicinity. Under specific conditions this effect should be extractable from remotely acquired infrared images allowing detection, mapping and monitoring of gas vents/springs within large areas and short times. This article describes preparatory investigations for which emanating Earth gas was simulated by leading compressed air into the ground and releasing it in some depth via a metal lance. The thermal effect at the surface was observed from a nearby thermovision camera in summer and winter under varying meteorological conditions. A procedure was developed to reliably identify gas release areas within the recorded thermal images of the scene. The investigations are aiming at studies to be performed later in the Western Bohemia (Czech Republic) earthquake swarm region where especially CO2 of magmatic origin from European SubContinental Mantle (ESCM) emanates.

The Keban crystallized limestone of Permo-Carboniferous age is the oldest unit in the area. This unit is overlain by the middle-upper Eocene Kirkgec, it formation consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, limestone and marl alternations. The youngest unit in the area is the Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene Karabakir formation consisting of basalt, andesite and tuffs. Thermal Springs in the Kolan field issue along two major fault zones. The temperature of the hot springs is between 38 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Thermal waters in the area are heated by the geothermal gradient. The waters are classified as "hot'' or "very hot'' and as "brackish'' waters. On the basis of International Association of Hydrogeologists Classification (IAH), waters are grouped as "Ca - Na- HCO3 - CO2-bearing thermal and mineral waters''. Chemical analyses indicate a chemical composition of Ca>(Na+ K)> Mg HCO3> SO4> Cl. Saturation calculations reveal that the waters are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and aragonite while undersaturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite and halite minerals. On the basis of delta O-18, delta H-2 and H-3 isotope data, Kolan waters are of meteoric origin, recharged from high elevations and then circulated deeply.

J	Putkonen, J				Putkonen, J			Soil thermal properties and heat transfer processes near Ny-Alesund, northwestern Spitsbergen, Svalbard	POLAR RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACTIVE LAYER; SORTED CIRCLES; ARCTIC TUNDRA; SNOW COVER; PERMAFROST; SYSTEM; REGIME; ALASKA; WATER	The annually thawing active layer of permafrost is central to considerations of climate change consequences in arctic areas and interpretations of deep permafrost temperatures that constitute an exceptional archive of past climate change. Moreover, a sound understanding of the thermal regime of the active layer is of great interest, because all chemical, biological and physical processes are concentrated there. The author studied this layer by examining the soil physical properties and heat transfer processes that dictate soil temperatures for an arctic desert site in northwestern Spitsbergen. A wide array of soil physical properties based on field observations and laboratory measurements were defined. These include mineralogy, grain size distribution, local regolith thickness, porosity, density, typical soil moisture profile, heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Heat transfer processes were studied through modeling of soil temperatures, The heat transfer model accounted for much of the observed soil thermal regime. It was found that thermal conduction, phase change of soil water at 0 degrees C, and changes in unfrozen water content are the primary thermal processes that explain the observed soil temperatures in this field site. Melt-water infiltration, which is often overlooked in dw energy budget, causes abrupt warming events and delivers considerable energy to the soil in late spring. An increase in frequency or magnitude of infiltration events could mimic simple spring rime surface warming. Advection of ground water and soil internal evaporation were found to be generally unimportant at the site studied.

The mineral springs of the Scrajo spa (Sorrento peninsula, Italy): a case of "natural" seawater intrusion	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Sorrento Peninsula; Italy; Scrajo mineral springs; Seawater intrusion	THERMAL WATERS; SUBMARINE SPRINGS; KARST AQUIFERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOCHEMISTRY; GROUNDWATER; IMPACTS; ORIGIN	This paper deals with the mineral springs feeding the Scrajo spa in the Sorrento peninsula southeast of Naples, approximately 6 km from Castellammare di Stabia, another spa location. The Scrajo mineral water is sulphureous, salt-bromine-iodic and CO2-rich. The two hydromineral areas fall within the groundwater basin of Mt. Faito formed chiefly by limestones. Due to the high permeability of the limestones, there is considerable rainwater infiltration which recharges a basal fresh groundwater resting on denser seawater. This groundwater body feeds the mineral springs of the Scrajo spa, the springs of Castellammare di Stabia and some submarine springs. All the data gathered for the Scrajo springs led to propose the following mineralisation scheme: (1) The basal fresh groundwater of Mt. Faito (on underlying seawater) receives endogenous contributions of CO2 and H2S which cause a "natural" seawater intrusion within the fresh groundwater; (2) The upwelling of gases would appear to occur via the major faults which bound Sorrento peninsula to the NW; (3) During the year, the chemistry of the springs changes according to different degrees of seawater intrusion: the minimum occurs in June and the maximum in November. The close interaction between the sea and the Scrajo's mineral waters (but also those of Castellammare di Stabia) highlights their particular vulnerability not only to over-extraction of groundwater but also to climate change. Finally, a hypothesis is presented to explain the connection between the mineral waters rich in CO2 and H2S and the concentration of karst phenomena observed in the Scrajo area.

Geochemistry and isotope geochemistry of the Monfalcone thermal waters (northern Italy): inference on the deep geothermal reservoir	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Thermal water; Carbonate rocks; Stable isotopes; Dissolved gases; Italy	TECTONIC FEATURES; DISSOLVED-GASES; RAILWAY TUNNEL; HELIUM; CHEMISTRY; CARBON; EVOLUTION; SPRINGS; REGION; BASIN	Geochemical investigations were carried out to define the origin of the low- to moderate-temperature thermal waters feeding the Monfalcone springs in northern Italy. Chemical data indicate that waters approach the composition of seawater. Mixing processes with cold low-salinity waters are highlighted. The delta O-18 and delta D values are in the range -5.0 to -6.4 aEuro degrees, and -33 to -40 aEuro degrees, respectively, suggesting the dilution of the saline reservoir by karst-type freshwaters. A surplus of Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions with respect to a conservative mixing is ascribed to diagenetic reactions of the thermal waters with Cretaceous carbonates at depth. The measured Sr isotopic composition (Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio) ranges between 0.70803 and 0.70814; after correction for the surplus Sr, a Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio indicating Miocene paleo-seawater is obtained. The dissolved gases indicate long-lasting gas-water interactions with a deep-originated gas phase of crustal origin, dominated by CO2 and marked by a water TDIC isotopic composition in the range -5.9 to-8.8 and helium signature with 0.08 < R/Ra < 0.27, which is a typical range for the crust. A possible scenario for the Monfalcone thermal reservoir consists of Miocene marine paleowaters which infiltrated through the karstic voids formed within the prevalently Cretaceous carbonates during the upper Eocene emersion of the platform, and which were entrapped by the progressive burial by terrigenous sediments.

Apo is depleted of heavy isotopes owing to high elevation and landward location of the field. Rainwaters infiltrate the shallow grounds, circulate in short distances with almost no interaction with the host bed rocks, and effuse in the surface as cold springs.; Lakes and rivers are affected by surface evaporation while the acid SO4 springs are affected by both evaporation and steam-heating. Only the neutral-pH Cl springs have the signature of the deep thermal fluids. The parent fluids of the deep thermal brine contain Cl of 4,800 to 5,000 mg/kg, delta(18)O of -4.62 to -4.13 parts per thousand and delta(2)H of -60.0 to -57.8 parts per thousand. Inside the Sandawa Collapse, boiling of the parent fluids resulted to a two-phase reservoir with lighter isotope contents. The thermal fluids laterally flow towards the west where they are affected by cooling and mixing of cold,,waters. Deep water recharge has delta(18)O of -10.00 parts per thousand and delta(2)H = -61.20 parts per thousand which come from the upper slopes of Sandawa Collapse (1580-1700 mASL).

Originating from different parts of Croatia, i.e. different types of aquifers, studied thermal waters provide insight into the range of concentrations of broad spectrum of elements in Croatian thermal waters. Covering a wide range of temperature (30 - 92 degrees C), studied thermal waters are generally classified as geothermal springs (Hrvatsko Zagorje and Lipik) and low-temperature geothermal reservoirs (Bizovac), differing from each other not only by temperature but also by geochemical composition. Thermal waters from Bizovac Spa, from the eastern part of Croatia, were found significantly enriched in majority of measured elements in comparison with waters from Hrvatsko zagorje and Lipik. Significant variability between studied waters was also observed regarding the rare earth elements levels and fractionation patterns, substantially different normalized REE patterns and wide range of Eu and Ce anomalies, ranging from 0.10 to 0.84 and from 3.48 to 159, respectively. Characterized by near-neutral to alkaline pH (6.8 - 8.1) and great variability with respect to the geochemical composition, studied waters were found to primarily reflect the underlying geology.

The impact of thermal water discharges on the surrounding potable water resources had also been assessed. It was found that thermal water did not contain any toxic elements (mercury, antimony, arsenic) which are detrimental to human consumption. Thermal waters were found to be less mineralized compared to the non-thermal ground waters. The water types of the thermal and non-thermal waters were found to be mostly Na-Cl-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-HCO3, respectively. Silicate weathering and ion-exchange processes were found to be main factors that determined the dissolved solute concentration in the study area. Stable isotopic (delta O-18, delta H-2) analysis unequivocally established the meteoric origin of the thermal waters. Thermal waters in Unapdeo, Anekdev, Kundwa and Ratanpura were found to have distinct isotopic compositions signifying that separate reservoirs were feeding these hot springs. The application of chemical geothermometers showed a wide variation in the estimation of reservoir temperature. The quartz geothermometer produced the most reliable reservoir temperature estimate of 110 +/- 12 degrees C. Multicomponent geothermometry was found to better constrain the reservoir temperature. This modelling result indicated that the thermal water in this region had attained simultaneous equilibrium with respect to quartz, aragonite, stilbite, calcite, enstatite, heulandite, diopside minerals in the temperature range of 120 +/- 5 degrees C which could be taken as the subsurface reservoir temperature.

The delta C-13 values of thermal water ranged between -21.3 and -18.75 parts per thousand, which clearly reflect no/minimum contribution of carbonate minerals to the system.

The steam-heated waters in the Nukkakushi crater discharged with boiling temperature until 2002. Thermal waters at the Tokachidake spa area have similar compositions to fumarolic gas emitted from the summit craters, indicating that the waters formed by absorption of volcanic gas into shallow aquifers. Thermal waters at the Fukiage spa area were derived from the same aquifer as the Tokachidake spa area until early 1986. However, after that time, NaCl-type thermal water entered the Fukiage spa area during the increase in volcanic activity associated with the 1988-1989 eruption, thus leading to a clear increase in Cl concentrations and temperature. After the eruption, the supply of the NaCl-type thermal water was halted, and the Cl concentrations of the thermal waters decreased. In contrast, SO4 concentrations gradually increased in the Fukiage spa area after 1989, and the temperature has been maintained. These observations indicate that SO4-rich thermal water with a relatively high temperature entered the system instead of the NaCl-type thermal water. As was the case for the 1988-1989 eruption, the Cl concentrations at the Fukiage spa area increased in 2012 during an increase in volcanic activity, implying that the supply of the NaCl-type thermal water had resumed. However, the chemical changes in the thermal waters since 2012 are small compared with those before the 1988-1989 eruption, with oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions remaining nearly the same as those of meteoric waters.

Its potential mineral waters, tourism and the bottled mineral water industry is far from harnessed, hence the current survey of the essential elements such as Ca and Mg in the thirteen most promising medicinal springs of the African sub-region. A comparison of their concentrations in these waters indicate ranges for Ca and Mg suitable for both internal and external cures when compared with concentrations in selected springs used by some Polish health resorts. The concentrations for Ca in West Africa were lowest at 4.81 mg/dm(3) and highest at 110.22 mg/dm(3) while values for Mg had 1.94 mg/dm(3) as lowest and 43.75 mg/dm(3) as highest. The lowest level for the sampled springs in Poland was 144.29 mg/dm(3) and 1503.00 mg/dm(3) for Ca, as against 51.04 mg/dm(3) and 947.90 mg/dm(3) for Mg. While some of the spring waters are meteoric in nature-low mineralised, and hence suitable for bottling as dietary waters, others are moderately mineralised to chlorosodic mineral waters suitable for application in hydrotherapy. 'Possotome' water is the only mineral water brand in Benin Republic, but there are none in Nigeria. This result might perhaps boost the knowledge of medical hydrogeologists, the World Health Organisation, and prospective investors in the bottled mineral water industry in West Africa.

Thermal phenotyping of stomatal sensitivity in spring barley	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						barley; drought stress; phenomics; stomatal conductivity; thermography; thermometry	WATER-STRESS; CANOPY TEMPERATURE; LEAF TEMPERATURE; WHEAT GENOTYPES; DROUGHT-STRESS; PLANT; FIELD; THERMOGRAPHY; AGRICULTURE; REFLECTANCE	Thermometry and thermography are alternative methods used for measuring stomatal conductivity via transpirative cooling. However, the influence of mixed soil-plant information contained in thermal images compared to thermometric spot measurements on the measurement quality and relationships to agronomic traits remains unclear. To evaluate their respective influence, canopy temperature was measured simultaneously by two infrared thermometers (thermometry), which were oriented oblique to the plant canopy and mounted on a tractor, and a hand-held, nadir oriented thermal camera (thermography) in irrigated and drought-stressed spring barley cultivar trials in 2011. Canopy temperatures were separated from soil temperatures and extracted from the thermal images by matching thermal and RGB images. Thermometric measurements conducted at the beginning of shooting during a stable period of high radiation were more closely related to total plant biomass and straw yield at harvest than thermography under both irrigated and drought-stressed conditions. Taking into account the results of this evaluation, thermometry was used for assessing the agronomic importance of stomatal sensitivity, the earliness of stomatal closure, of spring barley cultivars subjected to different water supply in 2013. In this year, 16 spring barley cultivars were grown under mild drought stress and rainfed conditions. A stomatal sensitivity index was derived relating canopy temperatures of the cultivars grown under rainfed and drought-stressed conditions to each other. Under rainfed conditions, stomatal sensitivity was negatively related to grain protein yield with a coefficient of determination of R-2 = .43. Under increasing terminal drought stress, positive regression slopes of stomatal sensitivity to grain yield, biomass yield and culms/m(2) were observed with coefficients of determination amounting to R-2 = .22, .31 and .36, respectively. Stomatal sensitivity negatively impacts agricultural production under well-watered conditions, but maintains productivity under conditions of terminal drought.

The maximum values of Fe, Mn, Sb, Zn, Cu and Pb were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Sb in Wadi Tinja, indicating that the surface water of the Ichkeul basin was largely acceptable. Diatom community composition and specific descriptors, including quantification of morphological alterations and mortality, were used to diagnose environmental stress. High abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki were observed at the Fe-rich site, which could reflect a response to metal contamination. Diatoms were stressed mostly by the influence of temperature and salinity, which drove species composition and increased mortality. Further research is required on the ecology of diatoms in Ichkeul thermal springs. The use of diatoms as indicators of ecosystem health in the Ichkeul area requires additional knowledge of diatom diversity in the ecoregion.

Springs often occur because faults modify groundwater flow pathways leading to discharge from aquifers with sufficiently high pressure. This study reviews the key characteristics and physical processes, field investigation techniques, modelling approaches and management strategies for fault-controlled spring systems. Field investigation techniques suitable for quantifying spring discharge and fault characteristics are often restricted by high values of spring ecosystems, requiring mainly non-invasive techniques. Numerical models of fault-controlled spring systems can be divided into local-scale, process-based models that allow the damage zone and fault core to be distinguished, and regional-scale models that usually adopt highly simplified representations of both the fault and the spring. Water resources management relating to fault-controlled spring systems often involves ad hoc applications of trigger levels, even though more sophisticated management strategies are available. Major gaps in the understanding of fault-controlled spring systems create substantial risks of degradation from human activities, arising from limited data and process understanding, and simplified representations in models. Thus, further studies are needed to improve the understanding of hydrogeological processes, including through detailed field studies, physics-based modelling, and by quantifying the effects of groundwater withdrawals on spring discharge.

Riparian shading and groundwater enhance growth potential for smallmouth bass in Ozark streams	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						bioenergetics; climate change; growth; Micropterus dolomieu; Missouri; Ozarks; riparian vegetation; springs; streams; temperature	WATER TEMPERATURE; HABITAT; CRAYFISH; MISSOURI; FISHES; FOREST; DYNAMICS; DECAPODA; CLIMATE; ADULT	Moderation of stream temperatures by riparian shading and groundwater are known to promote growth and survival of salmonid fishes, but effects of riparian shade and groundwater on to be growth of warmwater stream fishes are poorly understood or assumed to be negligible. We used stream temperature models to relate shading from riparian vegetation and groundwater inflow to summer water temperatures in Missouri Ozark streams and evaluated effects of summer water temperatures on smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, growth using-a bioenergetics model. Bioenergetics model simulations revealed that adult smallmouth bass in non-spring-fed streams have lower growth potential during summer than fish in spring-fed streams, are subject to mass loss when stream temperatures exceed 27 degrees C, and will likely exhibit greater interannual variation in growth during summer if all growth-influencing factors, other than temperature, are identical between the two stream types. Temperature models indicated that increased riparian shading will expand the longitudinal extent of thermal habitat capable of supporting adult smallmouth bass growth in spring-fed stream reaches when mean daily air temperatures exceed 27 degrees C. Optimum growth temperature (22 degrees C) will be present only in spring-fed streams under these conditions. Potential for increasing shade through riparian restoration is greatest for streams < 5 m wide and along north-south reaches of larger streams. However, temperature models also indicated that restoring riparian shading to maximum levels throughout a watershed would increase the total stream mileage capable of supporting positive growth of adult smallmouth bass by only 1-6% when air temperatures are at or near average summer maxima; increases in suitable thermal habitat would be greatest in watersheds with higher spring densities. Riparian management for maintenance or restoration of the thermal habitat of adult smallmouth bass during summer should be focused in areas strongly influenced by groundwater. Restoring riparian shading along spring-fed warmwater streams will likely benefit adult smallmouth bass growth. and may ultimately influence population sizes.

However, isolation of these bacteria from any extra-host environmental niche has not been reported so far. Here, we have characterized the genomic plasticity and antibody response of Bordetella bronchiseptica strain HT200, isolated from a thermal spring. Genomic ANI value and SNPs-based phylogenetic tree suggest a divergent evolution of strain HT200 from a human-adapted lineage of B. bronchiseptica. Growth and survivability assay showed strain HT200 retained viability for more than 5 weeks in the filter-sterilized spring water. In addition, genes or loci encoding the Bordetella virulence factors such as DNT, ACT and LPS O-antigen were absent in strain HT200, while genes encoding other virulence factors were highly divergent. Phenotypically, strain HT200 was non-hemolytic and showed weak hemagglutination activity, but was able to colonize in the respiratory organs of mice. Further, both infection and vaccination with strain HT200 induced protective antibody response in mouse against challenge infection with virulent B. bronchiseptica strain RB50. In addition, genome of strain HT200 (DSM 26023) showed presence of accessory genes and operons encoding predicted metabolic functions pertinent to the ecological conditions of the thermal spring.

Radiocarbon ages indicate that waters of T >45 ? were infiltrated during the Ice Age (more than 11 thousand years ago), on the higher elevations of the Buda-Pilis Hills, whereas waters of lower temperatures were infiltrated during the Holocene. For the origin of dissolved sulphate, two hypotheses can be set up: (1) the dissolved sulphate originates from the oxidation of the sulphide (pyrite) of Oligocene Clay Formation; (2) it is the dissolution product of the sulphate minerals (gypsum and anhydrite) of older carbonaceous rocks (limestone and dolomite). The isotopically stable sulphur composition of the dissolved sulphate in the thermal water (delta S-34 = 9.7 parts per thousand to 17.7 parts per thousand) indicates its marine origin, so likely it dissolved from the older Permian evaporites.

Water quality and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in karst landscapes of North Island, New Zealand: influences of water sources, habitat type and anthropogenic disturbances	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						limestone; cave; spring; autogenic; allogenic; groundwater	LAND-USE; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY; NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS; THERMAL TOLERANCES; HEADWATER STREAMS; FLOW PERMANENCE; CAVE STREAMS; SPRINGS; IMPACTS	In karst landscapes, aquatic habitats differ in terms of the relative contributions of different water sources (allogenic surface stream vs autogenic karst groundwater) and their geomorphology. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure in these habitats is likely to vary in response to this heterogeneity, as well as to the physicochemical differences between water flowing through pasture vs native forest dominated catchments. Surveys were conducted to examine the influences of water source, habitat type (main stream-ways and side passages in caves, and epigean springs) and surrounding land use (native forest or pasture) on the water quality and benthic community structure in the Maniapoto Karst, North Island, New Zealand. Generally, springs and cave side passages received more autogenic water, indicated by lower temperatures and higher conductivities, than the main stream-ways of caves. However, in terms of community structure, the epigean springs and cave side passages were most distinct from each other, whilst the main stream-ways of caves were intermediate between the other two habitats. Temperature and nitrate concentrations were higher in sites surrounded by pasture than those in native forest, but surrounding land use exerted less influence on macroinvertebrate community structure than habitat type. A comparison of community structure in caves with high and low tourist traffic failed to identify any significant effects.	[Reid, D. J.; Wright-Stow, A. E.; van Houte-Howes, K. S.

Geological-structural surveys were carried out to define the structural setting of the area and to characterize geometries and kinematics of fault systems. Chemical (major components) and isotopic analyses (delta O-18 parts per thousand, delta H-2 parts per thousand, H-3, delta C-13 parts per thousand([DIC]), delta S-34 parts per thousand([SO4]))) were performed on thermal water and cold springs. A geophysical survey was also conducted by means of both Magnetotelluric and Electrical Resistivity Tomography methodologies, in order to gain insight into the resistivity distribution at depth and to indirectly image the subsurface structure. This multidisciplinary approach proved to be a powerful tool, since it unravels the complexity of this natural geothermal system and provides useful suggestion for reconstructing the fluid circulation outflowing at the Equi Terme thermal spring. Results pointed out how the E-W oriented fault system (the Equi Terme Fault) play a key role in controlling the thermal groundwater outflow, and the chemical-physical features of this resource. This structural lineament separates high permeability carbonate complexes (footwall), in which both shallow and deep flow paths develop, from a medium-low permeability succession (hangingwall) that contains evaporitic formations from which thermal water acquires a high salinity and a composition of the Na-Cl (Ca-SO4) type. During the uprising along the fault system, the thermal water is also affected by a mixing with shallow fresh-cold waters that lead to a strong seasonal variation in the chemical-physical properties of the thermal springs.

Vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved nutrients (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus), phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity were determined in an eleven-station transect encompassing the entire 636 km length of the lake. Pronounced horizontal variability in hydrodynamic conditions was observed, with the southern region of the lake being strongly thermally stratified while the middle and north basins were largely isothermal through July. The extent of depletion of surface water nutrients, and the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass and productivity, were found to be strongly correlated with the degree of thermal stratification. Horizontal differences likely reflected the contribution of two important factors: variation in the timing of ice-out in different parts of the lake (driving large-scare patterns of thermal stratification and other limnological properties) and localized effects of river inflows that may contribute to the preliminary stabilization of the water column in the face of intense turbulent spring mixing (driving meso-scale patterns). Examination of the relationships between surface water inorganic N and P depletion suggested that during the spring and early summer, phytoplankton growth in unstratified portions of the lake was largely unconstrained by nutrient supplies. As summer progressed, the importance of co-limitation by both N and P became more apparent. Uptake and regeneration rates, measured directly using the stable isotope N-15, revealed that phytoplankton in stratified portions of the lake relied primarily on NH4 as their N source. Rates of NH4 regeneration were in approximate equilibrium with uptake; both processes were dominated by organisms <2 mu m. This pattern is similar to that observed for oligotrophic marine systems. Our study underscores the importance of hydrodynamic conditions in influencing patterns of biological productivity and nutrient dynamics that occur in Lake Baikal during its brief growing season.

The potential of raw material extraction from thermal brines - Successful milestones of the BrineMine project	OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE			English	Article							TATIO GEOTHERMAL-FIELD; UPPER RHINE GRABEN; WATERS; CHILE; GEOCHEMISTRY; TEMPERATURE; RECOVERY; SPRINGS; LITHIUM; DISCHARGES	The BrineMine Project is a German-Chilean multi-disciplinary research project realized by research and industry partners. The focus is on development of strategies for raw material and water extraction from geothermal springs (Brine Mining) in Chile. The topics can be separated into a geologicalfgeo-chemical part and a mechanical engineering part, which are processed in close cooperation by the project consortium. In the first part, the economic potential of the dissolved raw materials in thermal spring waters in Chile is assessed by analyzing existing geochemical data of different sites. This is complemented by hydrogeochemical and geophysical exploration campaigns. The second part focuses on the development, construction and implementation of a prototype for pre-treatment and concentration ofgeothermal brines. With the comprehensive expertise of the team, a treatment strategy was developed and tested in a geothermal power plant, enabling controlled silica precipitation in order to overcome this limiting factor for geothermal energy production and associated raw material extraction. In this study, successful milestones of the BrineMine project are presented. The economic potential of elements in Chilean thermal waters is demonstrated. Additionally, the global potential of Brine Mining is outlined. The development of the silica treatment strategy is further described, as well as a possible integration of a prototype into an operating geothermal power plant. Finally, the construction and implementation of a large-scale first-generation prototype are presented with promising field results.

Thermal water with a temperature of 62-73 degrees C is now produced at 125 L/s from 4 drilled since 1994, causing some springs to go dry. A management plan is needed to maximize the benefits of this resource, for which currently proposed uses include district heating and green houses as well as in new spas in the area. The best use for the water from each spring or well will depend on its temperature, chemistry and location. The thermal waters are Na-Mg-HCO3-SO4 fluids that contain a significant amount Of CO2 gas. Isotope results (O-18,H-2, H-3) indicate that thermal waters have a meteoric origin: rainwater percolates downward along fractures and faults, is heated at depth, and then rises to the surface along fractures and faults which act as hydrothermal conduit. The basement around the Banaz Hamambogaz1 resort is comprised by the Paleozoic metamorphic schist and marbles exposing 8 km south and 15 km north of Banaz. Mesozoic marble, limestone and ophiolitic complex are observed a few km west and northern part of Banaz. These units were cut a depth of 350-400 m in boreholes drilled by MTA. In the area, lacustrine deposits are composed of fine clastic units which are alternated by gypsum, tuff and tuffites of 200-350 m thickness. The marble and limestones comprise the hotwater aquifer while lacustrine deposits make up the impermeable cap.

The sedimentology, geochemistry, structural characteristics and hydrogeology of the mound, which is associated with the Euganean geothermal field and the related complex structural framework of the Schio-Vicenza fault system, were investigated. A palaeo-environmental model of the deposit has been reconstructed clarifying the connection between the travertine deposition and the regional structural setting. Calcium-rich thermal waters rose from spring orifices (estimated temperature from 54 degrees C to 61 degrees C based on geochemical calculations) and produced a mound made of coalescent shield-like bodies. The dominant lime-mudstone facies resulted from the accumulation of lime mud at the bottom of shallow crater-like basins located on top of stacked cones. Soft sediment deformations affecting the lime mud sediment were most probably produced by the recurrent uprising of gas bubbles. The overlying crystalline crusts were deposited on the flanks of the mound by waters overflowing from the vents with laminar flux. A deep hydrothermal circuit with a long period of water-rock interaction is supported by geochemical analyses. Furthermore, a local extensional regime, enhancing the migration of thermal fluids to the surface, is inferred based on the results of the structural analysis carried out on the fault/fracture mesh that affects the mound. These results corroborate the well-established relation among travertine deposits, hydrothermal systems and fault systems, and substantiate the structurally controlled conceptual model of the Euganean hydrothermal system, suggesting that both the thermal and the fault systems were active at least since 34ka.

J	Ullman, D; Brown, J; Cornillon, P; Mavor, T				Ullman, D; Brown, J; Cornillon, P; Mavor, T			Surface temperature fronts in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Great Lakes; AVHRR; remote sensing; water temperature; thermal fronts; thermal bar	SATELLITE IMAGES; EDGE-DETECTION; SST IMAGES; MICHIGAN; STABILITY; ONTARIO	The distribution and variability of surface temperature fronts in the Great Lakes is studied using an II year time series (1985 to 1995) of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images. After the removal of cloud contaminated pixels as well as those potentially ice covered, an edge detection algorithm identifies surface temperature fronts in each image. The probability of detecting a front in the Great Lakes is highly variable from lake to lake as well as seasonally. Fronts during the winter months generally have cold water on their shallow side and appear in progressively deeper water as winter progresses. The properties of the winter fronts are consistent with a formation mechanism involving strong surface cooling over a sloping bottom. A spring transition occurs, whereby these fronts disappear and are replaced by nearshore thermal bar fronts with warm water found on their shallow side. The time of this transition depends upon the lake, occurring first in Lake Erie, next in Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, and finally in Lake Superior. These fronts are also observed to progress slowly into deeper water as nearshore waters warm. The classical thermal bar front (4 degrees C) is seen in all of the lakes but most of the fronts during the spring peak in frontal activity have temperatures greater than 4 degrees C, suggesting that the thermal bar marks the offshore edge of a more extensive frontal zone. Frontal activity declines during summer in all lakes except Superior.

The pirite orebody was interested in the lower part, by thermal groundwater, originally oursourcing from thermal springs at an elevation about few meters a.s.l. Ground water had been pumped down to less than 250 m below the sea level to allow the ore mining. After the closure of the mine, about 30 years ago, the water level has been taken into control, but now there is the need to let the water progressively raise. The mining method also adopted a cemented backfill of the voids. The paper describes this case ando refers in particular of possible instability problems, on the environmental consequences, on the evaluation of groundwater flow and characteristics, telated to the groundwater level rebound after closure, also on the basis of some monitoring techniques.

Only Dereli springs are hosted by non-metamorphic carbonates and ophiolitic rocks. The carbonated rocks of the lower parts of the Neogene sequence are also secondary reservoir rocks. The measured surface temperatures of thermal waters are between 33 and 54 degreesC. Most of the thermal waters are characterized as Ca-Mg-SO4-HCO3 type although there are a few Ca-Na-HCO3, Na-CaSO4 and Ca-Mg-HCO3 waters. Calcium concentrations in the thermal waters are 89-354 mg/kg. High SO4 contents of the thermal waters (up to 1309 mg/kg) are related to rocks and minerals in the Red Unit below the Emet borate deposits. Although the SO4 concentrations are high and SO4 is the major anion, gypsum and anhydrite are undersaturated for all of the thermal waters indicating that dissolution Of SO4 is still taking place in the reservoir. Thermal waters are oversaturated at outlet conditions with respect to calcite, chalcedony, dolomite and quartz. According to the activity diagrams thermal waters are likely to form illite as an alteration product in the reservoir and Ca and Mg contents are controlled by exchange with smectite. Reservoir temperatures obtained by silica geothermometers and assessments of the saturation states of minerals are more appropriate for Emet geothermal waters. Assessments of the various geothermometers suggest that reservoir temperature is around 75-87 degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A model for the evolution of the thermal bar system	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Thermal bar; convection; lakes	NATURAL-CONVECTION; CAVITY; HYDRODYNAMICS; TEMPERATURE; CIRCULATION	A new framework for modelling the evolution of the thermal bar system in a lake is presented. The model assumes that the thermal bar is located between two regions: the deeper region, where spring warming leads to overturning of the entire water column, and the near shore shallower region, where a stable surface layer is established. In this model the thermal bar moves out slightly more quickly than predicted by a simple thermal balance. Also, the horizontal extent of the thermal bar region increases as it moves out from the shore.

In the present research, we investigate major and trace elements, as well as hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, of 10 hot springs sites located along the WQF, which are recharged by infiltrated precipitation from 1.9 to 3.1 km. The hydrochemical types of most analyzed geothermal waters are HCO3SO4-Na, SO4Cl-NaCa, and SO4-Ca, proving that they are composed of immature water and thus are characterized by weak water-rock reactions. The heat storage temperature range was from 44.1 degrees C to 101.1 degrees C; the circulation depth was estimated to range between 1.4 and 4.3 km. The results of annual data analysis showed that Na+, Cl-, and SO42- in hot springs decreased by 11.20% to 23.80% north of the Yangbi Ms5.1 earthquake, which occurred on 27 March 2017, but increased by 5.0% to 28.45% to the south; this might be correlated with the difference in seismicity within the fault zone. The results of continuous measurements of NJ (H1) and EYXX (H2) showed irregular variation anomalies 20 days before the Yangbi Ms6.4 earthquake. In addition, Cl- concentration is more sensitive to near-field seismicity with respect to Na+ and SO42-. We finally obtained a conceptual model on the origin of groundwater and the hydrogeochemical cycling process in the WQF. The results suggest that anomalies in the water chemistry of hot spring water can be used as a valid indicator of earthquake precursors.

Geothermal potential and origin of natural thermal fluids in the northern Lake Abaya area, Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Abaya; Ethiopian Rift; Geothermal potential; Fluid chemistry	NOBLE-GAS; FIELD; WATER; GEOCHEMISTRY; EQUILIBRIA; DISCHARGES; REDUCTION; CHEMISTRY; VALLEY; CO2	In this study, the occurrence, chemical composition, origin and geothermal significance of thermal springs and fumaroles naturally discharging in the area located north of the Lake Abaya (western margin of the Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa) are reviewed in relation with recent tectonics. All thermal springs showed a dominantly Na-HCO3 composition, consistent with observations dating from at least 1972, and most of them displayed a narrow range of delta D and delta O-18 isotopic compositions for water similar to regional meteoric origins. These observations suggest that water-rock interaction processes occur in all aquifers and dominate the contributions of water that actively circulate within thermal fluids, and also suggest a similar elevation of groundwater recharge throughout the study area. Most of the thermal springs are dominated by a CO2-rich gas phase and discharge along the active faults bordering the western edge of the Main Ethiopian Rift valley. The delta C-13 values of CO2 and the (3)Fle/He-4 isotopic ratios are consistent with the presence of mantle-derived fluids similar to what is observed in many other areas along the kinematically active African Rift, especially within Ethiopia. The application of geothermometric techniques in the liquid and the gas phases suggests the presence of a deep reservoir in which the fluids equilibrated at a maximum temperature of approximately 180 degrees C. Additionally, the presence of fumaroles at boiling temperatures and water/mud boiling pools in several places suggests that the geothermal reservoir is positioned at a relatively shallow depth and likely located in the western side of the study area. The analysis of data collected throughout time reveals that the waters of Lake Abaya have experienced an increase in salinity of 20% paralleled contemporaneously with a decrease in pH and delta O-18 and delta D of water in the last 40 years; these changes do not appear to be related to climate change-induced increases in temperature or evaporation at the global scale.

J	Todinov, MT				Todinov, MT			Residual stresses at the surface of automotive suspension springs	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article								This study concentrates on the origins of unfavourable stresses at the surface of silicon-manganese automotive suspension springs. The residual stresses have been investigated at the various stages of the spring manufacturing-quenching, tempering and shot peening. Residual stresses from quenching depend in a complex fashion on the microstructural state of the surface and on the variation of the thermal gradient into the quenched spring wire. Contrary to expectations, oil-quenching of decarburised spring wire results in tensile residual stresses at the surface, while water quenching results in compressive residual stresses. The residual stresses do not disappear after tempering. Moreover the shot peening after quenching and tempering, if not conducted properly, may result in small compressive or even tensile residual stresses at the surface, which severely diminishes the fatigue resistance of the suspension springs.

Posocje Region, situated along the So a River, is one of the most seismically active areas of Slovenia. Our measuring stations close to the Posocje Region were installed in the thermal springs at Bled in 1998 and at Zatolmin in 1999. Since the beginning of our survey, radon concentration, electrical conductivity and water temperature have been measured continuously once every hour. In May 2002, the number of geochemical parameters monitored was extended to ionic concentration, pH and Eh, which are analysed once a month. Before seeking a correlation between geochemical and geophysical anomalies with seismic events, the influence of meteorological (atmospheric precipitation, barometric pressure) and hydrological (water table of the Tolminka River) factors on observed anomalies were studied. Results at Zatolmin showed that some radon variation during the period from June to October 2002 may be related to seismic activity and not only to meteorological effects.

Locally, both large karst springs and sulfurous thermal springs are closely located, and raise several questions on their origin. In this study, the phenomenon of the upwelling flow is supported by different types of evidences: Amazing density of sinkholes connected to hypogenic speleogenesis processes, constancy of temperature, and hydraulic conductivity of spring water, change of radon activity during the hydrological year, increasing of the hydraulic head with depth. Numerical code provides an estimation of the upwelling phenomenon in an unconfined aquifer feeding the karst springs, using MODFLOW tools. Based on the results reached, the phenomenon of the upwelling flow is able to explain the hydrological processes observed in the Telese karst area.

Towards the Understanding of Hydrogeochemical Seismic Responses in Karst Aquifers: A Retrospective Meta-Analysis Focused on the Apennines (Italy)	MINERALS			English	Review						karst aquifer; hydrogeochemistry; water quality; earthquake; Apennines	NORTHERN APENNINES; UMBRIA REGION; GEOCHEMICAL VARIATIONS; GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY; LAQUILA EARTHQUAKE; CHEMICAL-CHANGES; THERMAL SPRINGS; NOVEMBER 23; WATER; AREA	Earthquakes are known to affect groundwater properties, yet the mechanisms causing chemical and physical aquifer changes are still unclear. The Apennines mountain belt in Italy presents a rich literature of case studies documenting hydrogeochemical response to seismicity, due to the high frequency of seismic events and the presence of different regional aquifers in the area. In this study, we synthesize published data from the last 30 years in the Apennine region in order to shed light on the main mechanisms causing earthquake induced water changes. The results suggest the geologic and hydrologic setting specific to a given spring play an important role in spring response, as well as the timing of the observed response. In contrast to setting, the main focal mechanisms of earthquake and the distance between epicenter and the analyzed springs seems to present a minor role in defining the response. The analysis of different response variables, moreover, indicates that an important driver of change is the degassing of CO2, especially in thermal springs, whereas a rapid increase in solute concentration due to permeability enhancement is observable in different cold and shallow springs. These findings also leave open the debate regarding whether earthquake precursors can be recognized beyond site-specific responses. Such responses can be understood more comprehensively through the establishment of a regional long-term monitoring system and continuous harmonization of data and sampling strategies, achievable in the Apennine region through the set-up of a monitoring network.

Regional groundwater flow and interactions with deep fluids in western Apennine: the case of Narni-Amelia chain (Central Italy)	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						carbon dioxide degassing; heat flow; regional aquifer	CARBONATE AQUIFERS; FLUX MEASUREMENTS; HEAT-FLOW; CO2 FLUX; SPRINGS; UMBRIA; SOIL; QUANTIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; TEMPERATURE	The elemental fluxes and heat flow associated with large aquifer systems can be significant both at local and at regional scales. In fact, large amounts of heat transported by regional groundwater flow can affect the subsurface thermal regime, and the amount of matter discharged towards the surface by large spring systems can be significant relative to the elemental fluxes of surface waters. The Narni-Amelia regional aquifer system (Central Italy) discharges more than 13 m3 sec-1 of groundwater characterised by a slight thermal anomaly, high salinity and high pCO2. During circulation in the regional aquifer, groundwater reacts with the host rocks (dolostones, limestones and evaporites) and mixes with deep CO2-rich fluids of mantle origin. These processes transfer large amounts of dissolved substances, in particular carbon dioxide, and a considerable amount of heat towards the surface. Because practically all the water circulating in the Narni-Amelia system is discharged by few large springs (Stifone-Montoro), the mass and energy balance of these springs can give a good estimation of the mass and heat transported from the entire system towards the surface. By means of a detailed mass and balance of the aquifer and considering the soil CO2 fluxes measured from the main gas emission of the region, we computed a total CO2 discharge of about 7.8 x 109 mol a-1 for the whole Narni-Amelia system. Finally, considering the enthalpy difference between infiltrating water and water discharged by the springs, we computed an advective heat transfer related to groundwater flow of 410 +/- 50 MW.

These components are known as additional dead carbon, which dilutes the modern carbon used for dating, leading to the overestimation of C-14 ages. Four typical geothermal springs hosted by deep-seated faults and eighteen non-thermal springs and wells from the Dongguan basin of southern China were investigated to assess the circulation times of the hydrothermal system based on their radiocarbon contents. For the thermal springs, the circulation depth (approximately 3648 m), the apparent C-14 ages (20.15 to 12.97 ka) and the delta C-13-calibrated C-14 ages (16.02 to 8.55 ka) were estimated. The circulation speed of the thermal groundwater was as low as 0.46 m/a, which was too slow for a fracture hydrothermal system hosted by deep faults. The analysis of the helium and carbon isotopes in the thermal groundwater revealed the existence of mantle-derived carbon and thermally altered carbon from limestones. A delta C-13-He-3/He-4 illustration was proposed to correct for the additional dead carbon content. According to the reassessed C-14 ages, the groundwater circulation time was overestimated and the circulation speed of the thermal groundwater was underestimated in hydrothermal system. The reassessed C-14 ages can provide a more reasonable result than the initial slow estimate in the context of a fracture hydrothermal system hosted by deep faults. We conclude that measured C-14 contents should be reassessed during the use of radiocarbon dating for thermal groundwater if additional dead carbon exists in the water. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The active andesitic dome of La Soufriere has erupted eight times since 1660, most recently in 1976-1977. All these historic eruptions have been phreatic. High-salinity, Na-CI geothermal liquids circulate in the Bouillante geothermal reservoir, at temperatures close to 250 degrees C. These Na-CI solutions rise toward the surface, undergo boiling and mixing with groundwater and/or seawater, and feed most Na-CI thermal springs in the central Bouillante area. The Na-Cl thermal springs are surrounded by Na-HCO3 thermal springs and by the Na-Cl thermal spring of Anse a la Barque (a groundwater slightly mixed with seawater), which are all heated through conductive transfer. The two main fumarolic fields of La Soufriere area discharge vapors formed through boiling of hydrothermal aqueous solutions at temperatures of 190-215 degrees C below the "Ty" fault area and close to 260 degrees C below the dome summit. The boiling liquid producing the vapors of the Ty fault area has SD and delta(18)O values relatively similar to those of the Na-CI liquids of the Bouillante geothermal reservoir, whereas the liquid originating the vapors of the summit fumaroles is strongly enriched in O-18, due to input of magmatic fluids from below. This process is also responsible for the paucity of CH;I in the fumaroles. The thermal features around La Soufriere dome include: (a) Ca-SO4 springs, produced through absorption of hydrothermal vapors in shallow groundwaters; (b) conductively heated, Ca-Na-HCO3 springs; and (c) two Ca-Na-Cl springs produced through mixing of shallow Ca-SO4 waters and deep Na-Cl hydrothermal liquids. The geographical distribution of the different thermal features of La Soufriere area indicates the presence of: (a) a central zone dominated by the ascent of steam, which either discharges at the surface in the fumarolic fields or is absorbed in shallow groundwaters; and (b) an outer zone, where the shallow groundwaters are heated through conduction or addition of Na-Cl liquids coming from hydrothermal aquifer(s).

Hot springs are key exploration targets as they reflect active advection of thermal fluids derived from heating of meteoric waters circulating through the upper crust. However, establishing the timing of hot spring formation and the longevity of systems remain key knowledge gaps in our understanding of geothermal systems, such as how and when hydrogeologic conditions enable deep groundwater circulation to initiate. In this study, we demonstrate that a combination of multiple low-temperature thermochronometers and finite element modeling can be used to determine the lifespan of the Canoe River Hot Springs flow system, British Columbia, Canada. Rocks adjacent to the hot spring show evidence of reheating because of thermal fluids, an effect absent in more distant samples. Hydrothermal modeling of both constant and episodic flow scenarios over different timescales highlights that the hot spring likely began flowing between 4 and 6 Ma. This timing of flow onset implies the hot spring's formation may be linked to partial melting at the base of the crust, associated with nearby volcanic activity that has increased heat flow across the region in the late Cenozoic. These results have significant implications for the exploration of geothermal energy systems and for understanding the conditions required to form hot springs across British Columbia.

Contribution to the study of thermal waters in Greece: chemical patterns and origin springs of thermal water in the thermal of Lesvos	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						hydrochemistry; boron isotopes; water radioactivity	GEOTHERMOMETER; GROUNDWATER; VALLEY; BORON	The occurrence of thermal/spa waters on Lesvos Island is related to the presence of a major faulting system. Thermal waters are the result of mixing of meteoric and infiltrating seawater at great depth, and their total salinity depends on the percentage of seawater in their composition. According to the diagrams of main elements, trace elements and environmental isotopes, most of the components that determine the chemical composition of thermal waters such as sodium, chloride and sulphates originate from seawaters. On the other hand, the concentration of calcium, magnesium, boron, lithium, etc., was affected by water-rock interaction under high temperature conditions. Moving towards the surface, thermal waters may become polluted by influx of recent seawater, allowing their chemical composition to become similar to that of seawater. The thermal waters of Lesvos Island present relatively high concentrations of ammonia and redox sensitive metals because they are hosted in a reducing environment. They also exhibit low nitrate concentrations due to their mixture with recent fresh water. Finally, they show increased radon concentrations, ranging from 20 to 60 kBq m(-3) in the eastern and southern parts of the island, and about 230 kBq m(-3) in the north, in the area of Eftalou-Argenos.

The total number of microorganisms present in the water was of 7.6 and 4x10(4)/mL, respectively, being the majority alive (79 and 85.5%). The number of viable heterotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria, at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C, was lower than 100 cfu/mL. The strains of the heterotrophic bacteria isolated predominantly correspond to fermenters and non-fermenters Gram-negative bacilli, belonging to the Class Gammaproteobacteria (54.5%) and in smaller proportion to Gram-positive bacilli (29.1%) and cocci (16.4%). The most common identified species were: Aeromonas hydrophila in the Banos de Abajo spring, and Neudomonas putida in the Banos spring. Neither Faecal indicators nor pathogenic microorganisms were found. On the other hand, ammonifying, proteolytic, amylolytic, halophilic bacteria as well as fungi were detected in 100 mL of water. The microbial mats of Banos de Abajo and Eucaliptos springs were studied as well. Both mats consist of an association of filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoria, Pseudanabaena, Lyngbya), sphaeric cyanobacteria (Cyanothece, Synechocystis), diatoms (Cymbella, Fragilaria, Navicula, Nitzchia) and green algi (Cosmarium).

Using scanning transitiometry technique, we demonstrate that the simultaneous effect of temperature and pressure on the porosity of ZIF-8 leads to a non-standard temperature dependence of intrusion and extrusion pressures of MS, which allows to provoke water intrusion into the hydrophobic pores of ZIF-8 by decreasing the temperature of the system under constant pressure. A remarkably strong effect of intrusion on the isobaric heat-capacity of {ZIF-8 + water} MS is discovered.	[Grosu, Ya.; Nedelec, J. M.; Grolier, J. P.

Salient environmental changes include the onset of temperature/density stratification that is usually accompanied by a clear-water phase associated with a maximum of grazing Daphnia and a minimum of phytoplankton in the 0-5 m zone. Below this zone, as thermal stratification progresses, a deep maximum of phytoplankton can develop under strong thermal/density gradients and enhanced light penetration. Examples are resolved by estimations of chlorophyll-a, beam attenuance in situ and cell counts. Attributed origins are by sedimentation of diatoms, migration of flagellates, and depth-adjusted buoyancy of a gas-vacuolate cyanophyte. The transition period involves a decline of spring-associated diatom populations and a rise of summer-associated species. The generally low algal abundance within the transition phase has at least four origins - prior nutrient (Si) depletion, sedimentation, grazing, and low 'inoculum' levels of successor species. It can be augmented by the re-growth of species abundant in spring, by early extensions of normally summer species, by seasonally characteristic colonial chrysophytes, and by other phytoflagellates of small size that are seasonally less specific ('opportunistic') and probably critical for Daphnia grazing with consequent generation of the clear-water phase.

J	Scheihing, KW; Moya, CE; Troger, U				Scheihing, Konstantin W.; Moya, Claudio E.; Troeger, Uwe			Insights into Andean slope hydrology: reservoir characteristics of the thermal Pica spring system, Pampa del Tamarugal, northern Chile	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Groundwater flow; Geothermal springs; Chile; Seismic; Arid regions	DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON; ATACAMA DESERT; REGIONAL AQUIFER; ORIGIN; PRECIPITATION; ISOTOPE; MODELS; WATER	The thermal Pica springs, at 1,400 m above sea level (asl) in the Pampa del Tamarugal (Chile), represent a low-saline spring system at the eastern margin of the hyper-arid Atacama Desert, where groundwater resources are scarce. This study investigates the hydrogeological and geothermal characteristics of their feed reservoir, fostered by the interpretation of a 20-km east-west-heading reflection-seismic line in the transition zone from the Andean Precordillera to the Pampa del Tamarugal. Additional hydrochemical, isotope and hydrologic time-series data support the integrated analysis. One of the main factors that enabled the development of the spring-related vertical fracture system at Pica, is a disruption zone in the Mesozoic Basement caused by intrusive formations. This destabilized the younger Oligocene units under the given tectonic stress conditions; thus, the respective groundwater reservoir is made up of fractured Oligocene units of low to moderate permeability. Groundwater recharge takes place in the Precordillera at 3,800 m asl. From there groundwater flow covers a height difference of 3,000 m with a maximum circulation depth of 800-950 m, where the waters obtain their geothermal imprint. The maximal expected reservoir temperature, as confirmed by geothermometers, is 55 A degrees C. Corrected mean residence times of spring water and groundwater plot at 1,200-4,300 years BP and yield average interstitial velocities of 6.5-22 m/year. At the same time, the hydraulic head signal, as induced by recharge events in the Precordillera, is transmitted within 20-24 months over a distance of 32 km towards the Andean foothills at Pica and Puquio Nunez.

This study identifies a relationship between the spring SSS in the tropical northwest Pacific (TNWP) and the summer rainfall of the East Asian monsoon region (EAMR) during 1980-2017. Analysis suggests that the SSS-rainfall link involves the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land processes with a multifacet evolution. In spring, evaporation and water vapor flux divergence were enhanced in some years over the TNWP where an anomalous atmospheric anticyclone was established and a high SSS was well observed. As a result, the convergence of water vapor flux and soil moisture over the EAMR was strengthened. This ocean-to-land water vapor transport pattern was sustained from spring to summer and played a leading role in the EAMR rainfall. Moreover, the change in local spring soil moisture helped to amplify the summer rainfall by modifying surface thermal conditions and precipitation systems over the EAMR. As the multifacet evolution is closely related to the large-scale ocean-to-land water vapor transport, it can be well represented by the spring SSS in the TNWP. A random forest regression algorithm was used to further evaluate the relative importance of spring SSS in predicting summer rainfall compared to other climate indices. As the SSS is now monitored routinely by satellite and the global Argo float array, it can serve as a good metric for measuring the water cycle and as a precursor for predicting the EAMR rainfall.

Bedrocks are mostly limestone/dolomite and siliciclastics, thermal spring systems are present in the catchment, and the main industrial activity is represented by paper-mills. Main results obtained are: (1) major ions in solution appear to be basically controlled by precipitation and lithology, as well as subordinately by direct inputs of thermal springs, (2) human influence on metals in the waters along the main Serchio and Lima rivers is indicated at a number of sites by increases in concentration compared to the chemical composition of upstream tributaries, (3) S and O isotope compositions delineate two main sources for aqueous SO42-, that is dissolution of Triassic evaporite (directly or via thermal springs) and oxidation of sulfide dispersed in siliciclastic rocks. Anthropogenic contributions are probable, but they cannot be quantitatively assessed. Only SO42- in the notoriously polluted Ozzeri tributary is suspected to be largely anthropogenic, and (4) the chemical composition of bed sediments is mainly influenced by lithology, apart from a number of technogenic elements in the upper part of the Serchio River and in some tributaries. Contamination possibly occurs at other sites, but geochemical indications are weak. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since the temperature of spring wells of Vranjska banja ranges from 63 degrees C to 95 degrees C, this paper deals with the possibilities of their use as a renewable energy source. The paper gives the results of water physical and chemical characteristics testing, the temperature and discharge of ten geothermal springs in Vranjska banja, respectively A-1, A-2, EX-2, EX-3, EX-2, B-1, A-3, B-2, Gornji source and a collecting drain. Test results show that the water contains a high concentration of fluorine (8-8.5 mg/l), the impact of which exhibits in the treatment of cancer, nervous system diseases, and a lot of respiratory diseases, arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. Based on the results of the temperature and the abundance of the geothermal resources in Vranjska banja, the paper presents data on the heat capacity of the spa springs. The paper reports the results of the possibilities of using water springs of Vranjska banja water temperatures up to 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C in agriculture, industry, sports activities, etc.	[Maric, Andjelina; Pavlovic, Tomislav] Univ Nis, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Nish, Serbia	University of Nis	Maric, A (corresponding author), Univ Nis, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Nish, Serbia.	andjelinamaric14@gmail.com			Ministry of Education, Science and technological development of the Republic of Serbia [33009]	Ministry of Education, Science and technological development of the Republic of Serbia	The paper presents the result of work on the project 33009, which is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and technological development of the Republic of Serbia.		26	1	1	0	2	GEOGRAFSKI INST JOVAN CVIJIC SASA	BELGRADE	DJURE JAKSICA 9, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA	0350-7599	1821-2808		J GEOGR INST JOVAN C	J.

The temperature in individual springs varies between 4 and 15-degrees-C. Their rate of discharge is approximately 1 L s-1 to 18 m3 s-1, corresponding to a minimum temperature of 30-degrees-C within the base of the aquifer. The water, which contains a few ppm SO4(2-), 0.5 ppm S2-, and several thousand ppm NaCl, appears to be a mixture of turbid glacial meltwater and hot brine. Water chemistry and stable isotopes indicate that the salinity is not the result of simple dilution of modern seawater from the brackish zone beneath the coastal karst aquifer, but rather originates from a deep thermal brine component where concentrations and isotopic composition of various species are controlled by water-rock interaction in the source area of the brine. A value of DELTAdeltaS-34 of up to about 30 parts per thousand indicates that sulfide is a bioreduction product of sulfate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies revealed bacteria and fungal hypha in the organic slime, and larger spherical particles (approximately 3.8 mum diameter) that display high concentrations of Fe and S. These findings demonstrate the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria within the subpermafrost aquifer.

Tracing thermal and non-thermal water circulations in shear zones of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt zone, Eastern India- inferences on sustainability of geothermal resources	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Thermal waters; Mahanadi graben; Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt; Geothermal energy; Environmental isotopes; Radiocarbon dating	STABLE-ISOTOPES; DEEP AQUIFERS; HOT-SPRINGS; GROUNDWATER; EVOLUTION; CARBON; TEMPERATURE; ODISHA; AREA; GRANULITES	The development of the geothermal resources in India has not progressed mainly due to inadequate under-standing of the deeper thermal regime and uncertainty over the sustainability of heat source. In this study, isotopes, hydrochemical techniques and integrated geothermometric models have been applied to a low-medium enthalpy geothermal system belonging to shear zones of Mahanadi graben, Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (Eastern India) to gain better insights. Isotope results indicate that thermal waters are meteoric in nature and absence of delta O-18-shift suggests that the subsurface temperatures are below 200 ?. Distinct isotopic and hydrochemical signatures of thermal waters clearly suggest their origin from different geothermal reservoirs. Thermal waters at Atri/Tarabalo sites are derived from the southern part of the graben while at Athmalik, from northern part. Away from graben in southern direction (Taptapani site), the thermal waters are derived from rain occurring at elevated regions. Seasonal variations in chemical and isotope data are minimum in thermal waters. The estimated reservoir temperatures range between 92 and 124 ? with reservoir depths 1.6 - 2.4 km. Tritium data suggests that thermal waters are old and have 12-63% mixing with non-thermal water. The modelled radio-carbon age of thermal waters (13.3 - 20.7 Ka) suggests paleo-recharge of the reservoirs during Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), characterized by arid climate and low rainfall. A conceptual isotope model illustrating the genesis and circulation patterns of thermal and non-thermal waters is presented. The study highlights the potential of isotope-based studies in expanding the geothermal energy utilization in India.

Three are considered hot and two cold, and some contain hydrogen sulphide. A total of 68 taxa (24 genera) have been recorded. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) ranged between 0.63 and 2.01. The nMDS ordination showed that diatom assemblage composition was influenced mostly by conductivity, temperature and hydrogen sulphide concentration. Diatom assemblages found in the Galician springs differed from those in springs of other geographical locations with similar physical and chemical characteristics. The most species-rich genera were Nitzschia and Achnanthidium with 10 and 8 species, respectively. Achnanthidium exiguum and Achnanthidium saprophilum had the widest distribution. Denticula thermalis and Achnanthidium caledonicum were found in environments with relatively low mineralization and low temperature, whereas Rhopalodia gibberula, Rhopalodia operculata and Fragilaria crotonensis were found in mineral-rich springs with high temperatures. Achnanthidium exiguum, A. saprophilum, Achnanthes coarctata, Achnanthes exigua var. elliptica, Mayamaea atomus, Eunotia implicata, Gomphonema minusculum, Gomphonema minutum and Cosmioneis pusilla were present in the spring with high H2S content.

The predominance of Cl and Na, saturation indices of carbonate minerals, and Na/Cl and Ca/SO4 ratios of similar to 1 suggest that halite, sulphate, and carbonate are the solute sources. Integration of geochemical, delta O-18, and delta D values suggests that springs are mainly derived from meteoric water, ice-snow melt, and water-rock interactions. B concentrations range from 0.18 to 11.9 mg/L, with delta B-11 values of -4.37 parts per thousand to +32.39 parts per thousand, indicating a terrestrial source. The delta B-11-B relationships suggest B sources of crustal origin (marine carbonates with minor crust-derived volcanics); we did not identify a marine or deep mantle origin. The delta B-11 values of saline springs (+4.61 parts per thousand to +32.39 parts per thousand) exceed those of hot (-4.37 parts per thousand to +4.53 parts per thousand) and cold (-3.47 parts per thousand to +14.84 parts per thousand) springs; this has contributed to strong water-rock interactions and strong saturation of dissolved carbonates. Conversely, the global geothermal delta B-11-Cl/B relationship suggests mixing of marine and non-marine sources. The delta B-11-Cl/B relationships of the CD-LP-SM are similar to those of the Tibet geothermal belt and the Nangqen Basin, indicating the same B origin. These differ from thermal waters controlled by magmatic fluids and seawater, suggesting that B in CD-LP-SM springs has a crustal origin.

To test these hypotheses, we measured mean temperature and short-term (<2 days) temporal variability in water temperature at 23 shallow littoral sites in four basins of Lake Opeongo, Ontario, Canada. Water temperature in the littoral zone was most variable, both spatially and temporally, in the spring. Spring water temperature differed by as much as 7-15 degreesC among littoral sites in different basins (median difference among sites = 2-4 degreesC). Downwind sites were generally warmer and had more constant temperature than upwind sites, but the magnitude of these differences varied among basins of different sizes and shapes. Simple calculations of growth rates and of fish hatching times suggest that the observed variability in water temperature would result in differences in the productivity of different portions of the littoral zone.

Thermal and cold water emerge from various training. These sources present are taking their pathways along the faulting system. A complex multilayered reservoir has significant potential water. The karstic aquifer consists mainly on fresh water. Thermal water characterized by high salinity is carbo-gaseous. Collection and chemical analysis of major water elements in addition to nonionic mineral compounds (SiO2) and trace elements (Sr2+, F-, Br-) have determined a deep saline fluid circulation. The tectonic effect would be responsible for the current water flow. Cartography of fracturing system has identified a NNW-SSE hot spring distribution. Similar alignment can match the faulting system direction affecting the concerned study area.

In the present study, we have performed metagenomic sequence-based analyses to compare the taxonomic composition and functional potential of these hot springs. Proteobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and Aquificae are the dominant phyla in both geothermal springs, but there is a significant difference in the abundance of these phyla between As Burgas and Muino da Veiga. Phylum Proteobacteria dominates As Burgas ecosystem while Aquificae is the most abundant phylum in Muino da Veiga. Taxonomic and functional analyses reveal that the variability in water geochemistry might be shaping the differences in the microbial communities inhabiting these geothermal springs. The content in organic compounds of As Burgas water promotes the presence of heterotrophic populations of the genera Acidovorax and Thermus, whereas the sulfate-rich water of Muino da Veiga favors the co-dominance of genera Sulfurihydrogenibium and Thermodesulfovibrio. Differences in ammonia concentration exert a selective pressure toward the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Thermodesulfovibrio in Muino da Veiga. Temperature and pH are two important factors shaping hot springs microbial communities as was determined by comparative analysis with other thermal springs.

The interactive roles of temperature, nutrients, and zooplankton grazing in controlling the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom in a temperate, coastal ecosystem, Long Island Sound	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							CRITICAL-DEPTH; NARRAGANSETT-BAY; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; COMMUNITIES; WATERS; MICROZOOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; SUCCESSION; SILICATE; SVERDRUP	We examined biological, chemical, and physical processes controlling the onset and demise of the winter-spring bloom in the third largest US estuary, Long Island Sound (LIS), during 2010 and 2011. The spring bloom in LIS initiated in the absence of thermal stratification and peaked in early February when water temperatures were at an annual minimum (1.0 degrees C). Bloom initiation occurred when phytoplankton cellular growth exceeded zooplankton grazing and bloom demise occurred as temperatures rose and grazing exceeded algal growth. During the bloom collapse, nutrients were drawn down by >90% and the phytoplankton community was nutrient limited. A highly significant (r(2) = 0.81, p = 0.001), multivariate linear regression model using the percentage of primary production consumed daily by zooplankton and dissolved silicate concentrations hind-casted the timing and magnitude of the bloom within 10% of observed values each year. Mesocosm experiments performed during the winter-spring bloom demonstrated that higher seawater temperatures (+3.0 degrees C) increased zooplankton densities and grazing rates and decreased phytoplankton biomass. The winter-spring bloom in LIS was controlled by the interaction of phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing but not thermal stratification. Phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing were, in turn, influenced by nutrient availability and temperature. Continued climatic warming may lessen the intensity of the winter-spring bloom in this and other ecosystems in the future.

It is very important to characterize the temperature and the depth of geothermal reservoirs. The aim of this paper is the determination of type, origin source of water temperature, and depth of water circulation in the Ayub-Peighambar and Shafa (AP and SH) hot springs, located in NE Iran, using hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes (H-2 and O-18). AP hot spring has elevated temperature (36-40 degrees C) and as such is very important for balneotherapy and geotourism industry purposes. The average values of delta O-18 and delta H-2 for this hot spring (-10% and -73%, resp.) are analogous to that of geothermal and meteoric waters. This indicates that the heat source cannot be related to volcanic activities (with average delta O-18 value of about 5 parts per thousand) and it ismost probably associated with geothermal gradient with deep circulation of groundwater through faults. Based on Na-K geothermometers coupled with isotopic (O-18 and H-2) geochemistry the temperature of the AP geothermal reservoir was estimated to be in the range of 100-150 degrees C with 3-5 and 4.2 kilometres' depth, respectively. Chemically, the AP samples are CaSO4 facies with a chemically homogeneous source and steam heated waters type.

Facies architecture in depositional systems resulting from the interaction of acidic springs, alkaline springs, and acidic lakes: case study of Lake Roto-a-Tamaheke, Rotorua, New Zealand	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article							WAIOTAPU GEOTHERMAL AREA; TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; NORTH-ISLAND; HOT-SPRINGS; SILICEOUS SINTER; DRUMMOND BASIN; PRECIPITATION; RHYNIE; BIOTA	The facies architecture in hot spring systems tends to become more varied and complicated as the degrees of freedom in the system increase. Discharge aprons fed by waters from a single vent will, for example, be characterized by predictable downslope facies changes that reflect downslope changes in water chemistry and temperature. The facies architecture, however, becomes exponentially more intricate when more factors start to impact the system. This phenomenon is readily apparent in the geothermal area around Lake Roto-a-Tamaheke (located in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Village, Rotorua, New Zealand) where the facies architecture developed in response to the interactions between acid lake, acid hot spring, and alkaline hot spring depositional regimes, with additional extraneous sediment being brought into the area by volcanic ash clouds, wind-blown pollen, and surface run-off from the surrounding drainage basin. Much of the complexity in the facies architecture of this system stems from the temporal variance in the lake level and the variable life cycles of the acid and alkaline hot springs. Fluctuations in lake level controlled the extent of lacustrine deposits, and flooding commonly quenched spring activity. During some periods various minerals precipitated around the acidic springs, whereas during other periods silica precipitated around the hot alkaline springs that are preferentially located along faults that transect the area. The interaction of all of these variables produces depositional regimes with largely unpredictable and highly variable facies architectures. As such, they contrast sharply with the more organized spring systems that develop when one type of water flows from a single vent.

Using 168 rRNA amplicon sequencing, we investigated the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of the Huang Gang (HG) Creek, located in the trace metal-rich, acid-sulfate thermal springs zone of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG). Biofilms and water samples were collected from the upstream, midstream, and geothermal valleys and downstream of the creek. The results showed that the biofilm and water samples had distinct bacterial diversity and abundance profiles. Acidophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were found to be more abundant in water samples, whereas aquatic photosynthetic bacterial communities were dominant in biofilms. The water samples were contaminated with Legionella and Chlamydiae, which could contaminate the nearby river and cause clinical infections in humans. The upstream samples were highly unique and displayed higher diversity than the other sites. Moderate thermo-acidophiles were dominant in the upstream and midstream regions, whereas the geothermal valley and downstream samples were abundant in thermoacidophiles. In addition, functional profiling revealed higher expression of sulfur, arsenic, and iron-related functions in water and lead-related functions in the biofilms of the creek. As described in previous studies, the hydrochemical properties of the HG Creek were influenced by the TVG hot springs. Our findings indicated that the hydrochemical properties of the HG Creek were highly correlated with the bacterial diversity and functional potential of running water as compared to biofilms.

These cold and lukewarm springs have been utilized as thermal baths since Roman times, and in modem times, occasionally, chemical and bacterial contaminants of human origin have been detected in them. It is hence of considerable importance to know whether these contaminants originated from the Rozsadomb recharge area or from close to the discharge points. According to the results of a previous test in a cave passage high upon the hill, it was tempting to suppose direct connection between the Rozsadomb area and the Boltiv Spring in the foothills. The expected breakthrough-time predicted from this previous study was between 10 hours and 42 days. The tracer test documented in this present work showed that no breakthrough occurred. It is proposed therefore that the risk of the Boltiv Spring being contaminated by infiltration in the Rozsadomb recharge area is low as compared with the possible contamination from sources near the discharge area. We suggest that in this case the negative tracer test clearly helped to prove and to understand better the role of "natural attenuation" in the Rozsadomb area. The efficient dilution observed in the tracer test facilitated the prediction of a hitherto unknown, large, phreatic cave-system as well.

Radon activity measurements in water samples were performed using RAD 7 radon detector equipped with RAD H2O (radon in water) accessory and following a protocol proposed by the manufacturer. The results show that the concentration of Rn-222 in thermal waters ranges from 0.21 to 5.82 Bql(-1) with an average value of 2.4 Bql(-1). In addition to radon concentration, physicochemical parameters of water such as temperature (T), electrical conductivity, pH and redox potential (E-h) were also measured. The annual effective doses from radon in water due to its ingestion and inhalation were also estimated. The annual effective doses range from 0.2 to 0.75 mu Svy(-1) for ingestion of radon in water and from 2.44 to 9 mu Svy(-1) for inhalation of radon released from the water.

Mapping of the water ice content within the Martian surficial soil on the periphery of the retreating seasonal northern polar cap based on the TES and the OMEGA data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER; VIKING OBSERVATIONS; MARS; CYCLE; VAPOR; VARIABILITY; RECESSION; STABILITY; EXPRESS	Analysis of seasonal data from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) shows a significant increase in thermal inertia during autumn, winter and spring in the middle and high latitudes of Mars. At each stage of the northern seasonal polar cap's recession in spring a distinct high thermal inertia (HTI) annulus arises around the cap's edge. Within this annulus, we estimated and mapped the springtime water ice content in the daily thermal skin depth layer using spring and summer values of the thermal inertia in TES surface footprints. The results show that the average water content in the surface soil within the HTI annulus varies from similar to 5 vol % at the early stages of the seasonal polar cap retreating (Ls = 340 degrees-360 degrees) to similar to 1 vol % at later stages (Ls = 60 degrees-70 degrees). Maximum values of water ice content within the HTI annulus occur at Ls = 0 degrees-20 degrees (2-6 vol %) and Ls = 20 degrees-40 degrees (4-10 vol %). We analyzed the temporal and spatial relationship between the HTI annuli and the water ice (WI) annuli at the edge of the northern seasonal polar cap. The water ice within the WI annuli was mapped using a water ice spectral index the absorption band depth at the 1.5 mu m wavelength) derived from the OMEGA (Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite) imaging spectrometer aboard the Mars Express spacecraft. Recent OMEGA observations show that the WI annuli formation arises only around the retreating northern seasonal polar cap, never around the retreating southern seasonal cap. For this reason our study is confined only to the northern hemisphere. The observed relationship between the HTI and WI annuli in the northern hemisphere of Mars indicates a close physical interdependence between these two phenomena. Our results confirm that the seasonal permafrost exposed by the retreating northern polar cap (within the HTI annuli) is actively involved today in the condensation and sublimation processes in the modern water cycle on Mars. The water abundance in this annual condensation/sublimation cycle within the active layer may be an order of magnitude higher than all the annual water vapor abundance in the Martian atmosphere. Our results are consistent with existence of the positive mass balance of the northern permanent polar cap in the modern climatic period.	[Kuzmin, R. O.; Zabalueva, E.

Some 18 hydrogeological and 8 meteorological variables from documented data of Garab water samples for the years 1970, 1984, 2001, and 2011 are employed. The temporal trends show that the years 1984 and 2011 are classified as the humid and wet periods and the years 1970 and 2001 are classified as the arid and dry periods in the study area. Our results revealed that the concentrations of Ca2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, and CO32- were enhanced in the wet period by increasing carbonate precipitation and dissolution of surfacial Neogene Na-Cl soils. The recorded 8 degrees C difference between water temperature and air temperature can be related to thermogene conditions of spring water and thick travertine deposits, while the same variability of water temperature and air temperature in the wet and dry periods exhibits meteogene conditions of spring water and tufa generation. The hydrogeochemical analysis revealed that the abundant values of electrical conductivity (similar to 11,000 mu s/cm), total dissolved solids (similar to 6,700 mg/l), and CO2 (similar to 350 mg/l) together with the observed water type (Na-Cl and Ca-HCO3-SO4) are due to thermal water origin and possible leakage of fossil seawaters in deeper ground.

The program for these diagrams were developed as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application and compiled using Visual Basic 6.0, which has enabled to execute an Excel file from a program created by Visual Basic 6.0. The performances of all the four diagrams were validated by applying for the same chemical concentration data of the waters that was used by the original authors of these diagrams. The results obtained from this program were consistent with those of the original authors of these diagrams. As an example, CCWater is applied for chemical characterization of thermal waters from springs and geothermal wells of five geothermal fields of Mexico, in which four are electricity producing fields (Cerro Prieto, CPGF; Las Tres Virgenes, LTVGF; Los Azufres, LAGF, and Los Humeros, LHGF) and the fifth geothermal field (La Primavera, LPGF) is in exploration stage. Majority of the reservoir temperatures estimated by Na/K geothermometers from geothermal well waters of CPGF, LAGF, LTVGF, and LPGF are within the limits of accepted differences (within +/- 20%) comparing to the average BHTs of the respective geothermal well. The good performances of the geothermometers in predicting the reservoir temperatures from well waters is expected because the well waters are fully equilibrated and are of Cl type, thus fulfilling the basic requirements. In contrary, though the spring waters of LHGF and LAGF are of HCO3 type (immature) and exhibited no equilibrium conditions, they also predicted reliable reservoir temperatures. This unusual but important observation in the behavior of the spring waters of LHGF and LAGF was made possible to known by chemical classification of these waters in to different groups and estimation of the reservoir temperatures by considering each water type of a geothermal field as a separate group. This application has shown the importance of chemical type of water and the existing chemical equilibrium conditions in successful using these waters in estimation of the reservoir temperatures, and hence the necessity of the computer program like CCWater. The software CCWater is easy to use, reliable, freely available and will be useful in the application of ternary diagrams for chemical characterization and to evaluate the equilibrium conditions of geothermal waters, particularly during the initial stage of geothermal exploration.

New Actuation Mechanism for Actively Cooled SMA Springs in a Neurosurgical Robot	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Medical robotics; Intelligent actuators; Shape memory alloy	DESIGN; CONVECTION; LAMINAR	This paper presents the use of shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuators with real-time cooling to control the motion of the minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot (MINIR-II). A new actuation mechanism involving the passage of water as the cooling medium and air as the medium to drive out the water has been developed to facilitate real-time control of the springs. Control parameters, such as current, water flow rates, SMA predisplacement, and gauge pressure of the compressed air, are identified from the SMA thermal model and from the actuation mechanism. In-depth modeling and characterization have been performed regarding these parameters to optimize the robot motion speed. Forced water cooling has also been compared with forced air cooling and proved to be the superior method to achieve higher robot speed. An improved robot design and a magnetic-resonance-imaging-compatible experimental platform have been developed for the implementation of the actuation mechanism.

J	Zhang, L; Guo, LS; Liu, SW; Yang, Y; Shi, DY				Zhang Lei; Guo LiShuang; Liu ShuWen; Yang Yao; Shi DeYang			Characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of hot springs in Xianshuihe-Anninghe fault zone, Sichuan Province, China	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Xianshuihe-Anninghe fault zone; Hot spring; Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes; Groundwater recharge; Altitude	WATER; GEOCHEMISTRY; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEM; BLOCK; AREA	Isotopic feature and recharge sources of hot springs are very important to monitor a fault zone activity. This study investigated the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes and hydrochemical compositions at hot springs, cold spring, rivers and snowmelt water in the Xianshuihe-Anninghe fault zone in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The analytical results show the delta O-18 variation range from -19.04 parts per thousand to -12.71 parts per thousand with an average of -16.42 parts per thousand, and the range of delta H-2 from -144.07 parts per thousand to -88.63 parts per thousand with an average of -122.37 parts per thousand in the hot springs. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in river water change from -15.90 parts per thousand to -10.85 parts per thousand c and from -118.21 parts per thousand to -71.12 parts per thousand with averages of -13.86 parts per thousand and -98.99 parts per thousand, respectively. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of cold spring at Kangding are -13.66 parts per thousand and -106.74 parts per thousand, respectively. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of snowmelt water at Daofu are -10.27 parts per thousand and -65.41 parts per thousand c, respectively. The isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen are distributed around the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and local meteoric water line ( LMWL), indicating that the water recharge sources are meteoric water with unobvious oxygen isotope shift. The isotopic ratios of different water types show wide variations, indicative of the inconsistency of recharge sources among hot springs, rivers and snowmelt water. The isotopic values of hot springs have clearly isotopic altitude effect. The altitude effect of oxygen isotope is -0.23 parts per thousand c/100m and the hydrogen isotope is - 1.95 parts per thousand c/100m in the Xianshuihe-Anninghe fault zone. The oxygen isotope shift, the relevant ions ratios, a Na-K-Mg triangular diagram and Li and Sr concentrations indicate that most of the hot springs are with weak water-rock interactions. The isotopic characteristics, water-rock interaction and circulation depths suggest that the groundwater recharges are the long-distance migration meteoric water, and the groundwater are heated in underground thermal reservoirs and then rise to the surface along the faults. The investigative results are very important for understanding the characteristics of geothermal water circulation and fault activity and evolution in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.

The TDS and hydrochemical type of these two springs are 1360 mg/L and HCO3-SO4-Na type, and 246 mg/L and HCO3-Ca-Mg type, respectively. The Butterfly Spring is enriched in Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- due to dissolution of carbonate rocks. In contrast, the Xiaguan Hot Spring is enriched in Na+, K+, HCO3 and SO42 due to dissolution of albite, halite and ion exchange. The concentrations of the rare earth elements (REEs) in the Xiaguan Hot Spring and the Butterfly Spring range from 0.033 mu g/L to 0.071 mu g/L and 0.013 mu g/L to 0.018 mu g/L, respectively. The absolute concentrations of the medium rare earth elements (MREEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) are relatively higher than those of the light rare earth elements (LREEs) in the Xiaguan Hot Spring. The concentrations of the LREEs in the Butterfly Spring are relatively high. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of the Xiaguan Hot Spring and the Butterfly Spring vary from -102 parts per thousand to -107 parts per thousand and -11.6 parts per thousand to -13.8 parts per thousand, respectively, showing negative trends due to altitude effect. The data points of delta H-2 and delta O-18 of the two spring samples are close to the Global Meteoric Water Line and the Local Meteoric Water Line with a slight O-18 shift, indicating that the springs are meteoric in origin with a slight O-18 exchange with the surrounding rocks. The geothermal reservoir temperature of the Xiaguan Hot Spring estimated with SiO2 geothermometers ranges from 107.4 degrees C to 114.6 degrees C. The Xiaguan Hot Spring occurs in the metamorphic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Cangshan Group, and is recharged from infiltration of precipitation and snow-melting water. After undergoing a deep circulation, the groundwater is heated by heat flow and rises along the Tangzipu fault to form a hot spring of deep groundwater circulation type. The Butterfly Spring emerges in the Silurian limestone. Groundwater receives recharge from precipitation and snow-melting water in the western mountainous area, flows eastward along the fissures, and emerges on the lower slopes as a spring of shallow groundwater circulation type with ambient temperature.

Hydrogeochemical and seismological exploration for geothermal resources in South Sinai, Egypt utilizing GIS and remote sensing	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Thermal springs; Sinai; GIS; Hydrogeochemistry; Seismicity; Structural controls; Integration and prediction	STRESS-FIELD; SUEZ; GROUNDWATER; GULF; AREA; REGION; SEISMICITY; SUBSIDENCE; SUBPLATE; PLATE	Geographic information system and remote sensing techniques are used to determine the spatial association between the hydrogeochemical and seismological evidences of well-known geothermal fields in South Sinai. Manipulation, combination, overlay, integration and reattribution GIS functions have been used to explore the possible new occurrences of geothermal resources in South Sinai. Moreover, surface observations and lineament analysis of satellite images are used to delineate the active geothermal areas. The distribution of recent earthquake epicentres over South Sinai shows three main active trends (N 6A degrees E, N 40A degrees-75A degrees E and N 50A degrees-60A degrees W) conformable with the long fault extensions extracted from ETM+7 and ASTER GDEM satellite images and comprise the well-known hot springs in South Sinai. It is found that wherever the N 6A degrees E trend intersects both of N 50A degrees-60A degrees W or N 40A degrees-75A degrees E, the temperature of spring waters is remarkably increased. This feature could be attributed to the deep penetration of groundwater along the N 6A degrees E fault trend (Gulf of Aqaba trend). The seismicity patterns of well-known and newly predicted geothermal sites show that the majority of earthquakes have focal depth range between 3 and 33 km (within the upper Earth crust) and have micro to moderate magnitude (0.5 a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand Mb a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 4.5). In addition, the maximum focal depth of events reached up to 50 km at the Hammam Faroun area revealing the deep-seated thermal source. The main chemical type of the known thermal water of South Sinai is Cl-Na, indicating a long flow pathway of this water. The high calcium contents of thermal water of South Sinai are accompanied with remarkably low sulphates. This could be attributed to the microbial or thermal reduction of sulphates in contact with organic carbon which is confirmed by the emission of H2S gas observed at the known thermal field sites. As a result, thermal waters of the Hammam Faroun and Hammam Musa are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and anhydrite. The hydrochemistry of the newly predicted thermal sites exhibit similar pattern of the known thermal waters. Such observations are used as indicators to locate six predicted new occurrences of geothermal fields in South Sinai.

Evaluating CO2 flux and recharge source in geothermal springs, Garhwal Himalaya, India: stable isotope systematics and geochemical proxies	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Geogenic CO2 degassing; Water Chemistry; Stable isotopes; Upper Ganga Basin	MAIN CENTRAL THRUST; GANGA BASIN UGB; DELTA-D; WEATHERING PROCESSES; KUMAUN HIMALAYA; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; THERMAL WATERS; CENTRAL NEPAL; RIVER SYSTEM; HOT-SPRINGS	Evaluation of geogenic carbon fluxes between solid Earth and its atmosphere is essential to understand the global geological carbon cycle. Some of the key geogenic CO2 suppliers are the magmatic mantle and metamorphic degassing from active and quiescent volcanoes, fault zones, geothermal systems and CO2 rich groundwater. Indian Himalayan geothermal field hosts about 340 geothermal springs in natural as well as artesian condition that eject hot waters and volatiles with varied temperature and chemical composition. These sites provide an opportunity to analyse tectonically driven gas emissions and their impact on regional and global climate. Here we adopt a method for direct measurement of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC approximate to HCO3) concentration in the geothermal springs to estimate geogenic CO2 flux from an active region based on water discharge and area of geothermal system between the tectonic boundaries of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) of the Garhwal (Northwest) Himalaya. In the study area, geothermal spring water contain high delta C-13(DIC) ratio (- 8.5 parts per thousand to + 4.0 parts per thousand (VPDB)), and among the major ions, bicarbonate (HCO3-) varies by an order of magnitude from 1697 to 21,553 mu Eq/L; chloride and sodium vary from 90 to 19,171 mu Eq/L and 436 to 23181 mu Eq/L. The elevated concentration of Cl- and Na+ in geothermal spring waters suggests affinity towards their deeper origin. These geothermal springs cover a large area of nearly 10,000 km(2) of the Garhwal region showing a significant discharge of CO2 rich water with an estimated carbon dioxide degassing flux of similar to 7.2 x 10(6) mol/year to the atmosphere. Considering widespread occurrences of geothermal springs in tectonically active areas worldwide, the proposed direct measurement of DIC may be used as a reliable tool to estimate CO2 fluxes in different active orogenic settings within the Earth system. Results of stable isotopes of delta O-18 ((VSMOW)) and delta D ((VSMOW)) in these geothermal spring waters follow the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), suggesting affinity of their recharge through the meteoric origin.

J	Serianz, L; Rman, N; Golobic, I; Brencic, M				Serianz, Luka; Rman, Nina; Golobic, Iztok; Brencic, Mihael			Groundwater heat transfer and thermal outflow plume modelling in the Alps	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal spring; Thermal plume; Fault zone; Porous media; Bled; Slovenia	SOLUTE TRANSPORT; SOUTHERN ALPS; JULIAN ALPS; EXCHANGERS; FLOW; AQUIFER	Thermal water discharge within the gravity-driven groundwater flow system in the Alps and other similar areas around the world may be hidden in Quaternary deposits which, in these regions, often cover the regional aquifer. When thermal water drains into Quaternary deposits, the mixing of the deep thermal component and the cold shallow groundwater forms a thermal plume that extends parallel to the main groundwater flow in shallow system. In the Bled case study in Slovenia, the thermal water discharges from carbonate rocks into Quaternary glaciofluvial sediments, and as the Toplice spring at a rate of 5 l/s at an average temperature of 21.5 degrees C. Knowing the spatial extent and intensity of thermal outflow is essential to decision making related to the development and protection of this renewable resource. By approximating the thermal water outflow from a discharge zone as a planar source, a planar advective heat transport model can be used to evaluate its geometry and quantify rates. An analytical procedure follows rough assumptions leading to conservative results. Moreover, a numerical model using the FEFLOW code was applied for comparison with the simulations of the analytical model. The heat transport model was based on measured hydraulic parameters (e.g. groundwater levels) and borehole temperatures as well as on-site and international literature (e.g. dispersivity, thermal conductivity). Nine scenarios were applied accounting for different dimensions of the heat source and compared to the results of numerical simulations. Each scenario was verified by calculating the relative error between the analytical models and the measured borehole temperatures. The results confirm that the main outflow of thermal water can be determined using planar geometry, and is 200-300 m wide. The height of the thermal outflow zone is approximately 25 m, corresponding to the expected thickness of the direct contact between the fractured dolomite and the shallower Quaternary aquifer. Using the proposed widths and depths, the hidden natural thermal outflow rates are estimated at 57-86 l/s. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fluid geochemistry versus tectonic setting: the case study of Morocco	TECTONICS OF THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND NORTH AFRICA	Geological Society Special Publication		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd International Geological Congress	AUG 20-28, 2004	Florence, ITALY				HYDROTHERMAL HYDROCARBON GASES; MANTLE HEAT-FLOW; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; LIGHT-HYDROCARBONS; NORTHERN MOROCCO; THERMAL SPRINGS; EVOLUTION; WATERS; ATLAS; RIF	This paper presents the results of an extensive chemical and isotopic investigation on natural thermal and cold fluids (spring waters and associated gases) discharging throughout the main geological domains of Morocco. The chemical features of the thermal springs are mainly dependent on rock dissolution involving Triassic evaporite formations, producing either Na-Cl or Ca-SO4 composition, although mixing with shallower connate high-saline waters in Neogene post-orogenic sedimentary layers cannot be ruled out. Only in the Moroccan Meseta and Anti-Atlas domains have spring discharges probably undergone equilibration as a result of water-rock interaction in granites. Of the chemical and isotopic features of the gas seeps, He-3/(4) He ratios and delta C-13 -CO2 values indicate the occurrence of a significant contribution of mantle-derived gas, especially at Oulmes (Moroccan Meseta) and Tinejdad-Erfoud (Anti-Atlas), where associated waters are found to equilibrate at relatively high temperatures (c. 130 degrees C). These areas are also characterized by the presence of Pliocene to Quaternary basaltic volcanic rocks. Thermal discharges located along the Rif front and related to the NE-SW-oriented main strike-slip faults are associated with a CH4- and/or N-2-rich gas phase, derived respectively from a crustal or an atmospheric source. Some of them have significant contents of 3 He that could indicate the rising of mantle fluids. Such a striking isotopic signature, which is not related to any recent volcanism visible at surface, is likely to be associated with cooling magma at depth related to transpressive fault systems. Similarly, in the northeastern area, the small, although significant, enrichment of He-3 in the gas discharges seeping out along the Nekor seismic active fault and related to Pliocene-Quaternary basalts also suggests a deep-seated (magmatic) contribution. The distribution of thermal discharges is strongly related to the main active tectonic structures of Morocco. Moreover, this study indicates the presence of deep active tectonic structures in areas until now considered as stable. In particular, the NE-SW-trending Nekor fault may be part of a major system that extends to the Moroccan Meseta and into the Smaala-Oulmes fault system, thus emerging as a deep structure with crustal significance.

J	WORTHINGTON, SRH; FORD, DC				WORTHINGTON, SRH; FORD, DC			HIGH SULFATE CONCENTRATIONS IN LIMESTONE SPRINGS - AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CONDUIT INITIATION	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						KARST; SULFATE; SPELEOGENESIS; FLOW NETS; CARBONATE HYDROGEOLOGY	DISSOLUTION	Major ion concentrations in 404 springs in carbonate strata were found to exhibit a wide range in sulfate values. Sulfate concentrations are often much larger than would be expected from the analysis of samples from surface outcrops. Springs in the Sierra Madre Oriental (Mexico), the Rocky Mountains Front Range (Canada), and the Peak District (England) show similarities in sulfate concentration and in spatial distribution. Springs with high sulfate concentrations are found close to base level and are thermal. Springs with low sulfate concentration are found at higher elevations above base level and are not thermal. There is a direct relationship between sulfate concentration and spring temperature, and an inverse relationship with discharge. The results from the three areas described support a model of local and regional flow patterns, with deep regional flow providing the warm sulfate-rich water. The initial fracture porosity development in these aquifers may owe as much to the removal of sulfur minerals as to the removal of carbonate minerals. High sulfate values are frequently found in carbonate aquifers, so this model may be of widespread applicability.

J	Hilberg, S; Kreuzer, M				Hilberg, Sylke; Kreuzer, Matthias			IDENTIFICATION OF A DEEP FLOW SYSTEM IN A DOLOMITIC ALPINE AQUIFER - CASE STUDY WIMMERBAUERN SPRING, BAD ISCHL	AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Northern Calcareous Alps; hydrochemical modelling; thermal karst springs; isotope hydrology; dolomitic aquifer; Salzkammergut		In the context of a regional study about the aquifer characteristics of dolostones along the northern margin of the Northern Calcareous Alps (NCA) some remarkable properties of the spring "Wimmerbauernquelle" (WQ) in Bad Ischl were detected. Moderately increased water temperatures of 11.0 to 11.5 degrees C and Tritium values in the range of 4TU evidenced a significant contingent of deep circulating thermally influenced submodern waters. Comparably low electric conductivities in the range of 270 mu S/cm and a hydrochemical characterisation as Ca-Mg-HCO-type water with a balanced Ca-Mg-ratio and a nearly complete absence of other major 3 ions are a sign of a shallow pure dolomitic aquifer. The results seemed contradictory at first glance. Besides hydrogeological mapping and hydrochemical investigations inverse hydrochemical modelling was used to reconstruct the genesis of the spring waters and leads to a mix of 50% to similar to 85% of obviously deep circulating water, according to the assumed basic conditions. Interpretation of Tritium and SF measurements leads to a composition of 69% (+/- 5%) of the spring water that showed a mean residence time of 6 more than 60 years. A conceptual model of the aquifer combining the results of our study with the approach of various flow-systems leads to the interpretation that WQ can be seen as the geothermally influenced drainage of a deep aquifer.

Within the genus Naegleria, N. fowleri is most recognized as potential human pathogen causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Furthermore, the Naegleria spp. can serve as vehicles for facultative pathogens, such as Legionella. In this study, we identified Naegleria and Legionella based on the PCR amplification with a genus-specific primer pair and investigated the distribution of Naegleria and Legionella at five spring recreation areas in Taiwan. In this study of hot spring and other water sources in Taiwan, five Naegleria spp. were detected in 15 (14.2%) of the water samples. The most frequently detected was N. lovaniensis (n = 6), followed by N. australiensis (n = 5), and then N. clarki (n = 2). N. americana and N. pagei were detected once, respectively. The pathogenic species N. fowleri was not detected; however, N. australiensis considered to be a potential pathogen species in humans was found. Legionella spp., an endosymbiont of Naegleria, was detected in 19 (17.9%) of the water samples in this study. Overall, 5.7% of the water samples contained both Naegleria and Legionella. The Legionella spp. identified were L. pneumophila and L. erythra. Results of this survey confirm the existence of Naegleria and Legionella in Taiwan spring recreation areas. It should be considered a potential threat for health associated with human activities in spring recreation areas of Taiwan.

Water isotopic composition of springs generally corresponds to elevations much higher than those of the spring locations indicating high levels of the recharge zones and consequently, high hydraulic gradients and penetration of waters to deep crustal levels, up to 6-8 km taking into account the deep water temperatures estimated by geothermometers and a low thermal gradient (<20 degrees/km) in the coastal zone because of the direct contact of the continental crust and subducting oceanic plates with a cold surface at depths of 15-25 km. The observed He-3/He-4 ratios vary from 0.16 Ra to 4.59 Ra (where Ra = 1.4 x 10(-6), the air ratio) indicating that some springs discharge gas with a high contribution of mantle helium. High He-3/He-4 ratios were measured in springs located within and south of Colima graben, the apparent onshore border between Rivera and Cocos subducting plates, and also within the Rio Ameca graben at the northernmost part of the coastal forearc zone. The permeability of the crust south of Colima graben to the mantle He is interpreted as an evidence for a "slab window" between Cocos and Rivera plates due to different initial dip angles of subduction: a smaller one for the Rivera plate and a steeper one for the Cocos plate, although farther from the trench the Rivera plate subducts much steeper than the Cocos plate. Such geometry of subduction is in agreement with recent data on hypocenter locations of subduction earthquakes within this zone. High He-3/He-4 values in gases of the Rio Ameca graben are interpreted as a crustal permeability for mantle He at the Rivera plate margin. The nitrogen isotopic composition is in a good positive correlation with the N-2/Ar ratios. The highest delta N-15 of 4-5 parts per thousand was measured for gases with N-2/Ar > 300 and is associated with the high-salinity springs which are probably originate from the rock-water interaction with the accreted organic-rich sedimentary material.

Both have the same CI concentration (540 mg/kg) and the same isotopic composition (delta D of -66.5 parts per thousand and delta(18)O of -9 parts per thousand) under reservoir conditions, but they come from two distinct aquifers with different temperatures, i.e. 240 degrees C below La Cimarrona and 185 degrees C below La Castalia. The numerous thermal Na-Cl to Na-Cl-HCO3 springs located in the San Marcos area originate through dilution and boiling of these two geothermal liquids and different degrees of re-equilibration at lower temperatures. Silica and K contents are useful in discriminating between dilution, boiling and re-equilibration phenomena. Thermal Na-HCO3 waters, generated through conductive heat transfer or input of geothermal vapor or gases from below, delineate the extent of the geothermal reservoir(s) at depth. (C) 1998 CNR.

During three consecutive summers (2017-2019), we monitored by recording probes and fortnightly/monthly field campaigns the physical and chemical conditions of two rock glacier springs (ZRG, SRG) in the Zay and Solda/Sulden catchments (Eastern Italian Alps). The springs have contrasting hydrological conditions with ZRG emerging with evident ponding (pond-like), and SRG being a typical high-elevation seep (stream-like). Water temperature was constantly low (mean 1.2 degrees C, standard deviation 0.1 degrees C) at both springs. Concentrations of major ions (dominated by SO42-, HCO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+) and trace elements (As, Sr, Ba, U, Rb) increased, and water became more enriched in heavy stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) towards autumn. This solute and isotopic enrichment had an asymptotic trend at SRG, and a unimodal pattern at ZRG, where peaks occurred 60-80 days after the snowmelt end. Wavelet analysis of electrical conductivity (EC) and water temperature records revealed daily cycles only at SRG, and significant weekly/biweekly fluctuations at both springs attributable to oscillations of meteorological conditions. Several rainfall events triggered a transient (0.5-2 h) EC drop (of 5-240 mu S cm(-1)) and water temperature rise (of 0.2-1.4 degrees C) at SRG (dilution and warming), whereas only intense rainfall events occasionally increased EC (by 15-85 mu S cm(-1)) at ZRG (solute enrichment and thermal buffering), with a long-lasting effect (6-48 h). Building on previous research, we suggest that rock glacier springs with differing flow conditions, that is, stream-like and pond-like, have contrasting fluctuations of water parameters at different timescales. Thus, for pond-like springs, peaks of EC/solute concentrations might indicate a seasonal window of major permafrost thaw. Our quantitative description of the hydrochemical seasonality in rock glacier outflows and the physical and chemical response to precipitation events provides relevant information for water management in mountain areas under climate change.

Geochemical and isotope characterization of geothermal spring waters in Sri Lanka: Evidence for steeper than expected geothermal gradients	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Geothermal springs; Gondwana terrain; Aqueous geochemistry; Isotope geochemistry; Highland complex; Vijayan Complex	THERMAL SPRINGS; GROUNDWATER; BASIN; FIELD; PRECIPITATION; EQUILIBRIA; PRADESH; SYSTEMS	Seven geothermal springs from the Precambrian high-grade metamorphic terrain of Sri Lanka were investigated to assess their formation processes and to determine reservoir temperatures based on their chemical compositions. Silica-based geothermometric calculations for the Marangala and Nelumwewa springs showed the highest average reservoir temperatures of 122 degrees C and 121 degrees C, respectively. Samples of low temperature (< 35 degrees C) groundwater from nearby springs, piezometers and open wells were also collected for comparison. All samples were analyzed for their major and trace element compositions as well as stable isotope ratios H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16 (expressed as delta H-2(H2O) and delta O-18(H2O)). Discharge temperatures of the thermal waters varied from 39-62 degrees C. These waters showed low concentrations of selected trace elements (Fe < 0.09; Mn < 0.04; Cu < 0.01; Cr < 0.01; As < 0.025 mg/L)) and were also comparable to that of non-geothermal groundwaters. Stable isotope compositions of geothermal waters ranged from -6.5 to -5.0 parts per thousand for delta(OH2O)-O-18 and between -39 parts per thousand to -28 parts per thousand for delta H-2(H2O). In the non-geothermal waters, the isotope values were almost identical within the analytical uncertainties of 0.1 parts per thousand and 1 parts per thousand for delta H-2(H2O) and delta O-18(H2O), respectively. In addition, all isotope ratios of geothermal and non-geothermal water samples scattered around the local meteoric water lines for the dry and intermediate climatic regions of Sri Lanka, thus indicating origin from precipitation without further influences of evaporation or water rock interaction. This similarity to the local meteoric water lines also makes influences of seawater an unlikely factor. Close matches of geochemical and isotope data from geothermal and corresponding non-geothermal waters confirm the hypothesis of a common source. The proposed model for Sri Lanka subsurface waters is that rainfall from the dry and/or intermediate climatic zones percolates with little time delay downward through structurally weaker zones in high-grade metamorphic rocks. They are subsequently heated by steep or heterogeneous geothermal gradients that are most likely associated with the Highland-Vijayan thrust zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The key He-3/He-4 ratio runs along a single air-mixing line between the mantle and the crust, with the latter accounting for 97.0-97.3%. This suggests that the thermal source is radioactive decay in granodiorite, rock that intruded beneath the Cetaceous era sedimentary rock. Thermal water containing Na-HCO3 (SO4) evolved geochemically from stream water and groundwater containing Ca-HCO3. With respect to delta S-34, there are two types of thermal water: low temperature with low delta S-34 (-3.00 similar to+1.00 parts per thousand), and high temperature with high delta S-34 (+4.60 similar to+15.0 parts per thousand), which is enriched by the kinetic fractionation of H2S. The thermal water samples, except for a few, reached partial chemical equilibrium. The thermal reservoir temperatures were estimated as in the range of 90-126 degrees C by the K-Mg geothermometer of Giggenbach and the thermodynamic equilibrium of quartz and muscovite. This study suggests a conceptual model for the formation of geothermal water, including the thermal reservoir in the Bugok area.

From the hydrochemical point of view, two types of Na-Cl groundwater systems were identified: a cold aquifer system emerging at springs and exploited through boreholes for public water supply with different degrees of mineralization, and a hydrothermal system with issuing temperatures around 45 degrees C. Geothermometers applied to the thermal waters point to deep temperature around 167 degrees C and to immature waters, not reaching complete equilibrium with the reservoir rock.

J	Foster, AM; Clugston, JP				Foster, AM; Clugston, JP			Seasonal migration of Gulf sturgeon in the Suwannee River, Florida	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY			English	Article							ATLANTIC STURGEONS; MOVEMENTS; SHORTNOSE	The movements of 67 Gulf sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi equipped with radio transmitters were monitored in the Suwannee River, Florida, from March 1989 through August 1992. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the seasonal movement patterns and distribution of Gulf sturgeon while in freshwater, (2) to document relationships between water temperature and Gulf sturgeon movement, and (3) to determine whether springs were used as thermal refugia by these fish. Gulf sturgeon were detected entering the river from mid-February through April; they moved upstream at an average speed of 3.5 km/d to areas where they remained until October or November. Gulf sturgeon moved no more than 0.6 river km (on average) upstream or downstream from their established summer area. Gulf sturgeon began leaving the Suwannee River from mid-September through early November and moved downstream at an average speed of 6.2 km/d; all fish returned to the Gulf of Mexico by early December. Water temperatures associated with spring and fall migrations averaged 22.1 degrees C (range, 16.0-28.0 degrees C) and 21.3 degrees C (range, 16.9-26.8 degrees C), respectively. Gulf sturgeon were frequently close to springs throughout the warmest period, but none were located within a spring or the thermal plume emanating from a spring.

A comprehensive chemical and isotopic study of these waters supports previous suggestions that the waters are paleometeoric waters from the Nubian sandstone aquifer. The chemical and isotopic compositions of solutes indicate possible contributions from Tertiary sedimentary aquifer rocks and windblown deposits (marine aerosols and/or evaporite dust) in the recharge area. There is no chemical or isotopic evidence for mixing with Red Sea water. Gas effervescence from the Hammam Faraoun thermal water contains about 4% CH4 (delta(13)C = -32.6 parts per thousand) and 0.03% He having an isotopic ratio consistent with a mixture of crustal and magmatic He (He-3/He-4 = 0.26 R(n)). Geothermometers for the thermal waters indicate maximum equilibration temperatures near 100 degrees C. The waters could have been heated by percolation to a depth of several km along the regional geothermal gradient. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

To determine temporal and spatial patterns as well as factors affecting thermal discharge, data were acquired by the Landsat series of remote-sensing satellites for the period 1993-2020. First, sea surface temperature (SST) data for waters off NPPs were retrieved from Landsat imagery using a radiative transfer equation in conjunction with a split-window algorithm. Then, retrieved SST data were used to analyze seasonal and interannual changes in areas affected by NPP thermal discharge, as well as the effects of NPP installed capacity, tides, and wind field on the diffusion of thermal discharge. Analysis of interannual changes revealed an increase in SST with an increase in NPP installed capacity, with the area affected by increased drainage outlet temperature increasing to different degrees. Sea surface temperature and NPP installed capacity were significantly linearly related. Both flood tides (peak spring and neap) and ebb tides (peak spring and neap) affected areas of warming zones, with ebb tides having greater effects. The total area of all warming zones in summer was approximately twice that in spring, regardless of whether winds were favorable (i.e., westerly) or adverse (i.e., easterly). The effects of tides on areas of warming zones exceeded those of winds.

Field validation of wet thermal-time models	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Bromus tectorum; Seedling establishment; Seedbed ecology; Fire rehabilitation; Revegetation	SEEDLING EMERGENCE; BROMUS-TECTORUM; DORMANCY LOSS; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT; PATTERNS	Accurate prediction of germination for species used for semi-arid land revegetation would support selection of plant materials for specific climatic conditions and sites. Wet thermal-time models predict germination time by summing progress toward germination subpopulation percentages as a function of temperature across intermittent wet periods or within singular wet periods. Wet periods may be defined by any reasonable seedbed water potential above which seeds are expected to imbibe sufficiently to germinate. These models may be especially applicable to the Artemisia steppe of the western U.S.A. where water availability limits germination in summer and early fall while cool temperatures limit germination in late fall, winter, and spring when soil water is available. To test accuracy of wet thermal-time models we placed seedbags with seeds of five species commonly used in wildland revegetation, as well as two collections of the invasive annual grass, Bromus tectorum L. into Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomin-gensis Beetle and Young zone seedbeds for 19 field incubation periods over four seasons. Hourly surface (1-3 cm) soil temperatures and soil water potentials were measured near the seedbags. These data were input into thermal-time models which predicted time to germination for each seedbag retrieval date. Binomial data representing agreement (1) or lack of agreement (0) of predicted and actual germination for each retrieval date were analyzed using logistic regression. Thermal summation method, season, water potential threshold, and species most affected accuracy of predictions (P<0.0002). A model which defined a wet period as >=-1.5 MPa soil water potential and summed progress toward germination across intermittent wet periods was most accurate in predicting actual germination by a retrieval date. Across all species, this model correctly predicted that germination would occur in seedbags 75-95% of the time over the latewinter to mid-spring seasons, but only 50-71% of the time for the fall-early winter season when time of soil water availability was least. Although the wet thermal-time model overestimated time to germination for some species and seasons, its accuracy should be high enough to evaluate germination potential by mid-spring for different species, sites, and climatic conditions.
