AB    NOVELTY - The device (10) has a water collection                arrangement (20) comprising a convex surface (22)                for collecting water from atmospheric water vapor                through passive radiative cooling. A water storage                container (66) is in fluid communication with the                water collection arrangement. The passive radiative                cooling of the water collection arrangement lowers                surface temperature of the water collection                arrangement to below dew point temperature such                that the atmospheric water vapor condenses and                accumulates on the water collection arrangement and                flows under gravity to the water storage                container.
   USE - Passive radiative condenser device for                collecting potable water from atmospheric water                vapor.
   ADVANTAGE - The device allows the water collection                arrangement, appendages and a gutter to be coated                with coating material e.g. corrosion resistant                steel, to promote condensation so as to enhance                water collection potential of the device. The                appendages assist the water collection arrangement                in trapping atmospheric moisture from suspended                moisture e.g. fog, and from atmospheric water vapor                in a form of dew and frost in atmospheric                conditions. The device prevents fog, rain and snow                from being collected on the surface of the                condenser through radiative cooling processes when                the moisture is already suspended in the air, thus                avoiding condensation. The device is cost                effective, light in weight and portable.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device utilizes a convective shield                portion (42) that is formed from fiberglass or                polystyrene and a radiative shield portion (44)                that is formed from aluminum foil. The water                collection arrangement is formed from material                selected from a group consisting of metal, metal                alloy, composite material and plastic.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a                passive radiative condenser.

AB    NOVELTY - The moisture collection system (100) has a                moisture adsorption-desorption unit (11) which                consists of moisture adsorption material (111) that                is capable of adsorbing moisture contained in                atmospheric air introduced through an atmospheric                air introduction path (15A) and desorbing moisture                into air introduced through an air circulation path                (15F). A temperature control unit (40) regulates                the temperature of moisture adsorption material at                the time of adsorbing the moisture. The temperature                control unit regulates the temperature of moisture                adsorption material by supplying cooling water from                a cooling water supplier (41) to the moisture                adsorption-desorption unit through a cooling water                supply path (34) during the adsorption of                moisture.
   USE - Moisture collection system for use in                collection of water from low-humidity atmosphere                e.g. atmosphere of desert.
   ADVANTAGE - The temperature of moisture adsorption                material is controlled to match the adsorption                target temperature during moisture adsorption and                desorption target temperature during moisture                desorption in order to allow stable collection of                water from the atmosphere without depending on                external environmental factors. The electricity                cost is reduced by executing the moisture                collection process during nighttime. The time                required from moisture adsorption to moisture                collection is shortened by performing processing in                the adsorption mode and processing in the                desorption mode in parallel.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has a pump (46) moving                atmospheric moisture from a collection tank (16)                through a conduit (28) to a filter (24a - 24c).                Another conduit i.e. bladder (20), connects the                pressurized tank to the filter, where the pump                moves the atmospheric moisture from the filter                through the latter conduit to a sealed pressurized                tank. A valve i.e. gravity feed (32), is connected                to the pressurized tank when opened to release the                atmospheric moisture for dispensing into a vessel.                A circuit board (30) is provided with                microprocessors for programming activation of the                pump.
   USE - Apparatus for dehumidifying and purifying                atmospheric moisture.
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus utilizes a sensor strip that is                arranged in the sealed bladder in communication                with the circuit board that allows a filtration                system to know when water level in the bladder                requires the filtration system to shut off or turn                on. The apparatus extracts the moisture and                converts into potable water that is closed and                sealed, thus reducing possibility of bacterial                contamination through the filtration system.

The atmospheric air is also                cooled using zeolite material.
   USE - Atmospheric water collection device for                condensing moisture vapor, which serves as fresh                water source, in atmospheric air into water.
   ADVANTAGE - Passive solar energy is used as the preferred                power source for the water collection device,                making the device practical, economical and                flexible for installation in areas closer to the                equator where it is hotter year round or in areas                with high relative humidity. Increase in surface                area upon which condensation occurs is achieved by                preferably equipping the device with metal                intercoolers or more easily attainable materials                such as rocks or pebbles. The solar energy is also                used to power fans for assisting airflow into the                device and to improve the device capability to                condense water vapor to collect water. The                collection device is easily modified into a cooling                device for refrigeration, by preferably removing                the airflow system and placing the evaporator close                to a container for cold storage. The modular solar                heat exchange design is versatile enough for other                uses such as cooking, hot water heating, and drying                clothes.

A monitoring unit measures                temperature of an environment, humidity and air                pressure value and accurately locates an unmanned                aerial vehicle. A control unit is connected with                the sampling unit and the monitoring unit for                controlling operation of a monitoring unit. A                communication unit transmits a signal between the                control unit and a terminal. The terminal receives                the monitoring data and sends a control instruction                to a control unit to control the sample unit to                sample and receives sampling data.
   USE - System for collecting                soil-vegetation-atmospheric moisture based on an                unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on a gradient                ecological system.
   ADVANTAGE - The soil-vegetation-atmospheric moisture                collecting system can realize unmanned intelligent                collection of different gradient water vapor with                large difficulty of manual sampling, and can                increase the data collection range and breadth, so                that the sampling data is more reliable. The system                quality can be controlled within 5 kg, and the                system quality is improved. The convenience of                collecting water under different collecting                environment and collecting efficiency can be                improved. Small volume and light quality of liquid                nitrogen condensation can reduce the whole weight                of the unmanned aerial vehicle, thus the cost of                the system can be reduced. The accuracy of                collecting the soil moisture collecting device is                improved, when sampling. The internal condensing                channel is designed to be the combination of the                upper and lower condensing ring pipe and the                multiple condensing straight pipes, the condensing                efficiency of the water in the air to

AB    NOVELTY - The invention presents a device for production                of water from an atmospheric air. The technical                result is an increase of efficiency of the device.                The device for production of water from an                atmospheric air contains a channel for                transportation of a stream of an atmospheric air, a                cooling element placed in this channel and a system                of collection of condensation moisture. The                indicated channel is inserted in an external jacket                with the lower positive allowance and formation of                the channel between its lateral surface and a                lateral surface of the jacket for withdrawal of the                drained air outside, in which there are radiators                for heat pick up from hot seams of thermoelectric                batteries, the cold seams of which are in contact                with a cooling element placed in the channel for                transportation of the stream of the atmospheric air                and made as a set of metal rods or pipes located in                staggered rows chessboard order. Under them a                turbine of an electric power generator is located.                To prevent possible sedimentation of the condensed                moisture on the blades of the turbine above it                there is the indicated system of collection of the                condensation moisture. It represents the slant                chutes located in two layers in such a manner, that                they shut the cross-section of the channel for                transportation of the atmospheric air stream, but                with a sufficient positive allowance for transiting                through them of air. The outlet of the channel for                withdrawal of the drained air has a visor to                deflect the drained air aside from the inlet of the                channel for transportation of a stream of the                atmospheric air.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has a release chamber (104)                that comprises an opening and a sorbent                regeneration system. A capture structure (106) is                coupled to the release chamber and comprises a                collapsible support and multiple tiles (108)                coupled to and spaced along the collapsible                support, each tile comprises a sorbent material. A                lid (114) covers the opening of the release chamber                when the capture structure is in the release                configuration. A product outlet is in fluid                communication with the inside of the release                chamber and configured to receive a product stream                of enriched gas. The release configuration                comprises the collapsible support of the capture                structure is collapsed. The tiles are sufficiently                enclosed inside the release chamber that the                sorbent regeneration system can operate on the                tiles to release captured carbon dioxide from the                sorbent material and form an enriched gas within                the release chamber.
   USE - Device for passive collection of atmospheric                carbon dioxide.
   ADVANTAGE - The carbon dioxide (C0 2) losses can be                minimized during evacuation or other preparation                steps, because the evacuation or these other steps                occur before heat and moisture. The use of a water                saturated sweep gas such as steam (which at low                partial pressure is referred to as water vapor)                will keep moisture-swing sorbents from releasing                water, which can increase the overall efficiency of                the device.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the                following:
   a method for passive collection of atmospheric                carbon dioxide; and
   a system for passive collection of atmospheric                carbon dioxide.

AB       The condensation device consists of a condenser (1) sealed to a reservoir (2) which has apertures (3) in the top wall for the draining of the condensate. The air outlet tube (4) is mounted freely between the ribs formed by the walls of the condenser. At the top, there is a horizontal deflector (5). The intake tube for the pump (6) is lowered into the reservoir through its top wall.
   The reservoir and condenser are immersed in a well (7) of salt water (8). Atmospheric air (9), dried air (10), water vapour (11) and accumulated condensate (12) move through the device. Warm atmospheric air (9) of relatively low humidity goes to the well aperture, where it is saturated with water vapour (11) and passes down into the condenser (1). Contacting the internal surface of the condenser wall, the air is cooled, and droplets of moisture condense out on the wall and run through the apertures (3) into the reservoir (2). Dry air (10) passes into the lower end of the air outlet tube (4), and through it and past the deflector (5) to atmosphere.

AB    NOVELTY - Preparing atmospheric bleaching involves                simultaneously removing SO2, NOx, Hg and other                adsorbable pollutants in the presence of oxygen and                moisture. The removal of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by                activated carbon in the presence of oxygen and                moisture involves a series of reactions leading to                the formation of sulfuric acid. The used carbon is                regenerated by heating to restore its adsorption                activity. The desorbed SO2 is recovered as                elemental sulfur, sulfuric acid or liquid SO2, and                the desorbed mercury (Hg) and other trace                pollutants can be recovered in sulfuric acid or                separation and collection during sulfur production.                The conventional production of chitosan micro-nano                particles, lime water, ammonia water and ocean                water are purified by ultrafiltration to form                micro-nano aerosol, and ocean water is purified and                purified by multiple ultra-filtration to form a                micro-nano-scale aerosol.
   USE - Method for preparing atmospheric bleaching for                removing haze.
   ADVANTAGE - The method uses chitosan micro-nano dust                technology to change the acidic components in the                aerosol and atmospheric water gas components                through atmospheric humidity and wind force, which                effectively control the acidity of acid rain and                reduce acid rain to the greatest extent resulting                economic losses.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparing atmospheric bleaching involves                simultaneously removing SO2, NOx, Hg and other                adsorbable pollutants in the presence of oxygen and                moisture.

The set of sieves is used for 25-200 gram according                to the residual amount of different sieves, the                particle mass in the same particle size range to                the total mass is calculated, using Taylor standard                sieve, and the micropore size is 40 &#181;m.                The sieving method is hand sieving and vibrating                sieve. The sieving requires that the amount of dust                passing through each sieve per minute should not                exceed 0.003 gram, or 0.1 wt.% amount of dust                remaining on the screen without passing through the                sieve pores.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an airborne platform (100) that                is connected to a land-based platform. The airborne                platform comprises air fans (110) to intake moist                atmospheric air. A dehumidifier condenses water                from vapor and drains the condensed water to the                land-based platform. The exhaust air fans vent                dehumidified air back into the atmosphere. The                land-based platform comprises a water turbine and                generator for generating power for all electrical                components of the system, a collection tank for                accumulating condensed water, and an external                holding tank.
   USE - System for airborne atmospheric water                generation used for generation of electric power.                Can also be used in servicing agriculture,                converting humid deserts into vegetated landscapes,                generating clean water for human consumption,                planetary terraforming and creation of artificial                water vapor resupply cycle such as augmentation of                photosynthesis.
   ADVANTAGE - The severe flooding from storm clouds is                prevented by controllably removing the moisture                necessary for progressive rainfall. The external                power consumption and maintenance requirements are                reduced by repurposing water into hydrostatic                pressure to enable native power supply.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the                following:
   (1) a method of self-powering an atmospheric                water generation; and

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a solar collector (1) that is                provided with a first surface exposed to solar                energy and a second surface opposite the first                surface. A condenser (10) is fluidly connected to                generator to receive the coolant fluid. An                evaporator (12) is fluidly connected to the                condenser to receive the coolant fluid. The                evaporator is supported adjacent the second surface                of solar collector and arranged such that the                coolant fluid can affect a heat transfer to lower                the temperature of the solar collector and is                capable of causing atmospheric water to condense on                the solar collector. The absorber is fluidly                connected to the evaporator to receive the coolant                fluid. The absorber (8) is providing a chamber in                which the coolant fluid and absorption fluid can                combine to reform the working fluid solution. A                water collector is mounted at a lower end of the                solar collector and the water collector configured                to collect water that travels across the surface of                the solar collector by gravity.
   USE - System for condensing atmospheric moisture                free of an electrical compressor and used for                generating water using the absorption refrigeration                cycle in lieu of the electrical compressor such                that the generated water can be used for cleaning                the solar energy collection system.
   ADVANTAGE - The evaporator is located adjacent to the                surface of the solar collector and provides a                surface area to increase the efficiency of heat                transfer.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An independent claim is included for a method                for cleaning solar energy collection system that                includes generating water using absorption                refrigeration cycle.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus (102) has a planar element (104)                comprising a perimeter edge. A collection device                (116) is coupled with a portion of the perimeter                edge of the planar element. The planar element is                coupled with an elongated support element (108). A                storage vessel (122) accepts and stores accumulated                vapor condensate, and is coupled with the support                element. A rigid frame element (106) is coupled                with the perimeter edge of the planar element. A                pivot mechanism (110) is coupled with the planar                element and the support element. A control                mechanism (114) is coupled with the support                element.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves providing a weight                measurement instrument within an environmental                chamber. The atmospheric condition e.g.                temperature, is adjusted in the chamber to a test                condition. A test item e.g. welding consumable such                as welding electrode, is provided within the                chamber. An initial characteristic of the test item                is measured using the instrument. Test item                measurements are taken at different time during                control of the atmospheric condition in the chamber                to the test condition to determine a transfer                characteristic e.g. moisture transfer                characteristic, of the test item.
   USE - Used for determining a transfer characteristic                e.g. moisture transfer characteristic, carbon                dioxide transfer characteristic, nitrogen transfer                characteristic, of a test item such as material or                welding consumable e.g. welding electrode such as                solid welding electrode and cored welding                electrode, welding wire, welding flux, fill                material used in fabricating the welding consumable                (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The test item measurements are taken at                different time using the weight measuring                instrument, thus allowing collection of real-time                absorption or release properties in a variety of                atmospheres. The collection of the real time                absorption or release properties provides high time                resolution to capture both short-term and long-term                material transfer characteristics of the tested                welding consumable e.g. welding electrode. The                method reduces the number of tests required for                adequate data spreading, reduces the amount of                samples required to obtain multiple measurements                and reduces the testing cost and time, and improves                the testing accuracy.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a harvest chamber (102)                comprising an opening and a sorbent regeneration                system comprising a release medium i.e. steam, a                release medium emitter, and a liquid extractor. A                capture body (104) is coupled to and movable by a                support structure, where the support structure                includes first portion inside of the harvest                chamber and second portion outside of and above the                harvest chamber at height. A product outlet is in                fluid communication with the inside of the harvest                chamber, and receives a product stream of enriched                gas displaced by sweep gas inside the harvest                chamber, where the sweep gas is introduced to the                harvest chamber. A control system is                communicatively coupled to the support structure,                and cycles the capture body through a collection                configuration and a release configuration. The                sorbent material is one of a moisture swing sorbent                material and a heat swing sorbent material.
   USE - System for passively collecting atmospheric                carbon dioxide.
   ADVANTAGE - The system reduces wind drag and eliminates                release of water vapor from a sorbent material into                the harvest chamber. The system adjusts forces                holding a belt onto rollers to be large enough to                allow the belt to move forward without slipping                providing enough tension to prevent the belt from                sagging into undesired areas. The system prevents                or minimizes loss of carbon dioxide from the                harvest chamber.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a                method for passively collecting atmospheric carbon                dioxide.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a                system for passively collecting atmospheric carbon                dioxide.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an elongated frame (1)                developed to be installed vertically on a ground                surface. An air turbine (2) is installed on apex of                the frame for diverting air flowing in proximity to                the frame toward a hollow channel passed through                the frame. A spiral shaped tube (5) is connected to                bottom of the frame. A cylindrical shaped element                (3) is encased around the tube and mapped                underneath a surface for covering and supporting                the tube underneath said surface. A Peltier unit                (4) is integrated within the element for cooling                inner surroundings of the element in order to                increase temperature gradient developed between the                channel and the tube. An inbuilt microcontroller                actuates an electronic pump (7) assembled within                the element for pumping water toward a pipeline for                supplying water over soil.
   USE - Atmospheric water harvesting system for                harvesting atmospheric water diffused in the form                of water vapors in atmosphere by diverting and                condensing surrounding vapors along with utilizing                the condensed water in irrigating                orchards/nursery.
   ADVANTAGE - The system is capable of detecting intensity                of air flowing within proximity to a turbine, while                diverting and condensing air for water collection                in case detected intensity of the air falls below a                pre-fed value, so that the system provides a unit                for rotating the turbine in order to collect                maximum amount of the air. The system is capable of                detecting moisture level of soil present in                orchard/nursery such that the detected value                recedes a threshold value, so that the system                provides a unit for pumping the water collected                during atmospheric water harvesting toward the soil                in order to maintain an appropriate moisture level                within the soil. The system is eco-friendly and                reliable in nature.

AB    NOVELTY - The atmospheric water generation apparatus                (100) has an intake fan (102) that induces air into                a housing intake (104). The housing intake leads to                a chamber (116). A water mister (106) is provided                within the chamber. An evaporative coil (108) cools                the induced air and chamber. A water reservoir                (110) collects resulting water. A water outlet, an                air exhaust, an air filter and multiple water                misters are provided. A water collection tank is                segregated from the water reservoir. A shield is                provided over the water outlet. A pump (112) and a                pump line are provided recycling water to the water                mister. The air exhaust is recycled to the air                intake fan.
   USE - Atmospheric water generation apparatus e.g.                dehumidifier for condensing humidity in air and                containing resulting water for use with indoor                swimming pools and ice rinks.
   ADVANTAGE - The atmospheric water generation apparatus                generates water more efficiently due to the                combination of the water mister and cooling coil.                The outlet pipe has a shield that prevents water                direct from the mister from entering the outlet                pipe. The outlet can be covered using shield so as                to avoid mist from the misters from directly                entering the outlet. The air exhaust can be                recycled to the housing intake, which aids in                keeping temperatures low and in ensuring the                maximum amount of moisture is removed from the                air.

AB    NOVELTY - The analysis method involves optically interacting electromagnetic radiation (204) with a flowing atmospheric air (202) composition, and optically interacting the electromagnetic radiation with an integrated computational element (ICE) (208). The ICE is configured to analyze for a contaminant in the flowing atmospheric air. A detector (212) receives the electromagnetic radiation that has optically interacted with the flowing atmospheric air and ICE. An output signal is generated corresponding to characteristic of contaminant in the flowing atmospheric air.
   USE - Analysis method for evaluating contaminants in flowing atmospheric air used in oil and gas application. Uses include but are not limited to drying powder compositions e.g., cements, weighting agents, proppant to appropriate moisture content, supplying air to clean room environment for oil and gas testing operations, supplying air to treatment fluid for use in drilling, stimulation, and/or other subterranean formation operations.
   ADVANTAGE - Allows qualitative and/or quantitative analyzes of the contaminant to occur without having to undertake a time-consuming sample processing procedure since optical computing devices are configured to specifically detect and/or measure contaminant in flowing atmospheric air. The use of optical computational devices to detect the contaminants in the flowing is beneficial to allow for the collection and archival of information relating to contaminants of flowing air for particular operations, in conjunction with operational information, to optimize subsequent operations, and e.g. to determine acceptable contaminant levels. The optical computing devices perform calculations or analysis in real-time or near real-time without the need for time-consuming sample processing. Provides ability to analyze multiple characteristics of interest of contaminant or multiple types of contaminants within the flowing atmospheric air using single device and opportunity to assay additional characteristics simply by adding additional ICE components corresponding to those additional characteristics or corresponding to different types of contaminants.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram non-mechanistically illustrating how an optical computing device distinguishes electromagnetic radiation related to a characteristic of interest from other electromagnetic radiation.

AB    NOVELTY - The negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)                dressing (100) has a backing layer (101), an                adhesive skin contact layer and an absorbent                structure (103) is arranged between the backing                layer and the contact layer. The backing layer has                a moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) of                500-3500 g/m 2 /24 hours, as measured by                NWSP070.4R0. The contact layer is configured to                detachably adhere the dressing to a dermal surface,                where backing layer comprises a coupling element                (104) comprising a tubing (105) configured to                connect dressing to negative pressure source and to                a remote fluid collection unit.
   USE - Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)                dressing for use in a NPWT system for promoting                healing of surgical, acute and chronic wounds by                applying sub-atmospheric pressure to the wound                using a negative pressure pump.
   ADVANTAGE - The dressing improves the stability of the                therapy and provides a reliable portable NPWT                system. The moisture vapor transmission rate of the                backing layer allows moisture to evaporate from the                dressing, thus allowing the dressing to stay on the                skin for a longer period of time, and hence                reducing the wear time of the dressing. The                dressing allows the user or caregiver to remove the                canister and empty the collected liquid, and                re-attach the tubing to the housing again. The                small and controlled inflow of air can be                beneficial to more efficiently draw fluid from the                wound site and transport the fluid to the remotely                arranged fluid collection unit. The introduction of                air serves to resolve potential exudate blockages                or liquid columns formed in the tubing, thus                resolving the problems associated with liquid                columns and obstructions of the tubing.

AB    NOVELTY - The appliance (1) has a storage container,                which suspends moisture during operation of the                appliance and forms a bio-film on innermost                surfaces (29). A plasma generator (3) comprises a                piezoceramic element for producing cold atmospheric                pressure plasma. The generator is arranged at                distance less than 5 cm of the innermost surfaces                of the container. The plasma generator comprises                two electrodes, dielectric, a primary region and a                secondary region. The dielectric is made of plastic                material e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or PTFE,                and the electrodes are made of copper.
   USE - Household appliance e.g. dishwasher, dryer,                laundry treatment apparatus i.e. washing machine,                or washer dryer (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The storage container suspends moisture during                operation of the appliance and forms the bio-film                on the innermost surfaces, and the plasma generator                is arranged at distance less than 5 cm of the                innermost surfaces of the container, so that the                appliance exhibits enhanced control of                microorganisms and disinfection, odor removal and                revitalization functions and prevents most                extensive bio-films.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The storage container is selected from a                condensate collection vessel, a soft water tank                (24), a hard-water tank (18), a flushing water tank                (22), a rinsing shell (11) or a caustic solution                container (4). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also                included for a method for operating a household                appliance.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic front sectional                view of a household appliance.

AB    NOVELTY - The fluid drain arrangement (20) has a fluid                inlet (31), a collection chamber (32), a membrane                (40), a labyrinth chamber (34) and a fluid outlet                (36). The membrane is provided between the                collection chamber and the labyrinth chamber and                set with a closed state and an open state. The                membrane is designed to collect a coolant (14),                which enters the collection chamber via the fluid                inlet, in the collection chamber, in the closed                state, until the membrane changes from the closed                state into the open state and allows the coolant to                flow through the labyrinth chamber to the fluid                outlet.
   USE - Fluid drain arrangement for battery                arrangement of vehicle (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The labyrinth chamber can prevent or at least                make it more difficult for liquid, dirt or small                mammals from the environment to penetrate                unhindered. If a battery assembly is damaged, for                example by damage in an accident, the coolant can                leak out through the fluid drain assembly, and this                can prevent a short circuit in the battery                assembly. In the closed state, the membrane                preferably prevents atmospheric moisture from                penetrating into the battery arrangement. A sealing                element is provided between the labyrinth chamber                part and the cover part. This prevents coolant from                escaping at the connection point.

An outer                compartment (18) of the hygroscopic unit is adapted                to hold a bed of hygroscopic material (21) for                absorbing moisture contained in the enclosed                chamber, where the hygroscopic material is silica                gel.
   USE - Irrigating planter assembly for irrigating                crops or plants by bringing water from pipes,                canals and sprinklers.
   ADVANTAGE - The irrigation helps to improve crop growth                and quality which allows farmers to grow crops on a                consistent schedule, thus creating reliable food                supplies. The irrigating planter assembly                communicates a slow feed of water into the ground                to directly provide water to a growing plant. The                irrigation does not require periodic manual                watering or refilling of water for irrigating the                growing plant, since the assembly uses a wicking                mechanism which slowly draws water from the                assembly and transmits it to the roots of the                growing plants. The use of hygroscopic material to                absorb atmospheric moisture and readily condensed                inside the assembly due to solar still effect. The                condensate is collected for irrigation                purpose.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional side view                of the irrigating planter assembly depicting the                cycle of irrigating a growing plant.

AB       The system includes an intake unit for sucking contaminated gas which is used as an analysis object. The sucked gas is mixed with proper quantity of pure steam generated using a steam generator (14). The gas is passed through a condenser (8) where it is cooled and the moisture originally retained by the gas is condensed. The generated condensate contains contamination of higher concentration. An exhaust unit exhausts a portion of gas output without condensing, using a suction pump (7).
   The condensate is made to flow through a collecting reservoir (11) to a component analysing unit or an aliquoting unit (13), using a liquid feed system. Several suction tubes (51-54) are provided for intake of the gas. Switching valves (5a1-5a4) are provided in the tubes. The switching valves act as selecting units of intake of gas respectively.
   ADVANTAGE -   Offers light weight systems. Collects contaminated components, efficiently. Sucks up gas containing fusible micro dust in water and atmospheric air.

AB       A porous structure comprises a substrate which                is an interconnected network (11) of macropores                greater than 10 microns in diameter and a                microporous matrix (13) of interconnected                micropores less than 10 microns in diameter filling                the network and contained entirely within the                network. The outside edge of the microporous matrix                is at the outer surface of the substrate.
   The macroporous network (11) is impregnated                with a soln. of the material forming the                microporous network, containing a pore former and a                solvent therefor, The network (11) is immersed in                the soln. in a vacuum chamber and the pressure is                oscillated up and down below atmospheric. The                microporous matrix is formed by coagulation of the                soln. and extraction of the pore former and                solvent. Coagulation is e.g. by inhibiting                atmospheric moisture to form a 2-phase material,                and rich in matrix resin and the other rich in                water. The soln. can include a solvent miscible                with the resin solvent but not a solvent for the                resin.
   The macroporous substrate is polyethylene. The                microporous matrix is PVC.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   The structure is used as a membrane for                filtration e.g. for fluid clarification,                gasification or degasification, waste treatment,                oil and water separation, oil reclamation or                entrapment, air analysis, dust collection or                aerosol filtration.

AB    NOVELTY - A system has a solar collector system that generates a thermal gradient within the enclosure (100). A volume of air (150) is within the enclosure. Multiple orifices (110,120) are positioned in the enclosure in a way that the enclosure possesses 180 degrees rotational symmetry. The orifices are in atmospheric connection with the outside environment. A filter e.g. hydrophobic membrane covers each orifice. The position of the orifices facilitates circulation of the volume of air within the enclosure. A desiccant (130) is placed within the enclosure.
   USE - Environmental control system for a solar collector.
   ADVANTAGE - The system provides for the improved balance of free convection induced by a temperature gradient, orifice geometry, and moisture capacitance inside the module. It provides for the minimization of moisture inside of the solar energy system. This results in an increased lifetime and improved performance of specific components of a solar collection device, i.e., the glass, semiconductor, coatings, silicone, electrical connections and lead components. The system provides freedom to mount the assembled solar collector on a tracking device in any orientation while maintaining the desired air circulation in any configuration. This provides for ease of installation, as less precision is needed in the final mounting configuration.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The desiccant is selected from the group consisting of molecular sieves, silica gel, and Montmorillonite clay. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of manufacturing a solar collection device with an internal controlled environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic front view of a solar energy collector enclosure during exposure to the sun.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a data collection module for                gathering satellite imagery capturing parameters                including vegetation health, land surface                temperature and soil moisture. A data processing                module performs atmospheric corrections,                georeferencing and mosaicking on a collected                imagery. A computation module calculates draft                indices based on a processed imagery. A predictive                modeling module employs machine learning algorithms                to forecast potential draft occurrences. An alert                mechanism triggers notifications based on detection                of potential draft conditions. A geographic                information system (GIS) integration module                visualizes draft patterns, severity and affected                areas.
   USE - Integrated system for predicting and providing                early warnings of draft conditions based on remote                sensing data in an agricultural industry, water                resources, human health and an ecosystem.
   ADVANTAGE - The system provides efficient solution to                problems of insufficient coverage area, large                amounts of complicated data, and ever-changing                nature of draft, thus benefiting at risk                populations, economies and ecosystems, which                improves draft manufacturing, management and                mitigation.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has a carbon dioxide pump                membrane (102) comprising a moisture-swing material                (104) that absorbs carbon dioxide when dry and                releases carbon dioxide when wet. A cavity (106)                comprises a first fluid. The carbon dioxide pump                membrane separates a first fluid (108) from a                second fluid (110). A water concentration gradient                (116) within the moisture-swing material of the                carbon dioxide pump membrane creates a carbon                concentration gradient (122) across the carbon                dioxide pump membrane that decreases from a second                carbon concentration (120) to a first carbon                concentration (118) moving from outside the cavity                to inside the cavity. The water is continuously                transported from the first fluid to the second                fluid through the carbon dioxide pump membrane                because of the water concentration gradient, and                carbon dioxide is continuously captured from the                second fluid by the moisture-swing material of the                carbon dioxide pump membrane.
   USE - Continuous carbon dioxide capture                device.
   ADVANTAGE - The continuous carbon dioxide capture device                is simple, efficient, low-cost, and can be operated                in a batch process, gathering in one phase and                releasing in another. The device can reduce the                energy and financial cost, as well as the                mechanical complexity and fragility, to a practical                level. It can passively collect atmospheric carbon                dioxide from the ambient air using sorbent                materials that capture the carbon dioxide from the                atmosphere and subsequently release it for use or                sequestration. It does not require the use of                mechanisms to transition devices between a                collection phase and a release phase, and does not                provide numerous potential points of failure.

TI Extraction of volatiles from tobacco by toasting            at two different temps. with volatiles collected            separately.
AU SENSABAUGH A J
AE REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO R J (RETO-C)
GA 1993271704
AB    NOVELTY - Flavour substances are produced from tobacco.                The tobacco is heated at two separate toasting                temps., the lower temp. first. At each stage                volatiles are driven off and these are separately                collected.
Independently claimed is a process producing a                flavour substance from tobacco. The moisture                content of the tobacco is reduced to less than 4%                w/w without removing volatiles. The dried tobacco                is then heated to drive off the volatiles which are                collected.
Pref. tobacco with a reduced moisture content                is placed in flask (132) heated by heater (134).                Nitrogen is supplied from tank (140). The nitrogen                and released volatiles leave through conduit (145).                The flow passes through two collection flasks (146,                148) each containing a sorbent, e.g. propylene                glycol. Pref. flask (14) is a moderate temp. trap,                while flask (148) is cooled and acts as a cold                temp. trap. A filter (152) traps any uncollected                extracts. Pref. the tobacco is heated to two                different toasting temps. differing by at least 50                deg.C. Pref., at atmospheric pressure, the first                temp. is 100-225 deg.C and the second 225-350                deg.C. The heating is carried out slowly so that                tobacco is heated evenly and there is not much                difference in temp. between that adjacent the                heater and that remote from the heater. Pref. the                collecting traps are changed as the toasting temp.                so that the volatiles released at the two temps.                are collected separately.
   USE - The flavour substances are used in many                smoking articles. The substances provide better                flavour esp. when used in smoking articles in which                heat is applied at a low temp. e.g. 80-200                deg.C.
   ADVANTAGE - The flavour substances are used in many                smoking articles. The substances provide better                flavour esp. when used in smoking articles in which                heat is applied at a low temp. e.g. 80-200                deg.C.

AB    NOVELTY - The cell has a protective cover (102) that                comprises an electrically-insulating material. An                electrically-conductive contact pad (128) is                configured to enable connection of the cell to                external devices. The contact pad is provided on an                external side of the protective cover that is                opposed to a current collector layer (12). An                exposed surface is bounded about the perimeter by                the electrically- insulating material. An                electrically-conductive pathway is provided between                the contact pad and the current collector layer.                The electrically-conductive pathway extending                through the protective cover and contacting a face                of the current collector layer at a connection                site.
   USE - Electrochemical cell such as lithium-ion cell                (claimed) and rechargeable cell such as secondary                cell.
   ADVANTAGE - The electrochemical cell can be connected to                an external device without forming reaction                products at the exposed surface of the current                collector layer during operation of the cell, thus                preventing the loss of electrical contact between                the contact pad and the exposed portion of the                collector layer after a few cycles of charging and                discharging the cell. The protective cover protects                the stack of layers from atmospheric constituents                such as moisture and/or oxygen, and protects the                encapsulating layer from moisture and oxygen. The                electrically-conductive pathway extends through the                protective cover and contacts the face of the                collection layer at the connection site, thus                providing a conductive path between the substrate                and the uncovered portion of collector layer that                is distal to the substrate, and hence allowing an                electrical connection to be provided between the                collector and the external device.

AB       Method determines pollutant concentration,                especially in vehicle exhaust gases . A constant                volumetric flow rate of exhaust gases and cleaned                air are mixed, from which mixture, a device                extracts a sample. This is collected into a sample                vessel during a measurement phase, before supply to                an analytical unit. The air is taken from the                surroundings, cleaned and stored in a pressure                vessel before mixing with the exhaust gases. Also                claimed is the equipment to carry out the process,                in which the gases are led through a venturi                section to the mixing chamber with a downstream                suction unit to secure constant flow. The air (54)                cleaning means (6) includes an air collection                pressure vessel (50), storing it ahead of the                mixing chamber (2).
   USE -   Used for sampling and analysing vehicle exhaust                gases.
   ADVANTAGE -   Catalytic devices can now produce waste gases                with contaminants at very low levels, such that                their concentrations approach those in ambient air.                Hence for an accurate determination, the air used                for dilution is itself cleaned to achieve an                accurate determination. The method provides a                controlled flow of air, as required for the                so-called constant volume sampling system of                monitoring exhaust gases. The device has high                redundancy, wide use, modular construction, mobile                application, and compactness. It can be used with                commercially-available instruments. The temperature                of the mixing air can be controlled, and reduced                moisture content increases measurement                accuracy.

AB       Inside a cylindrical pressure vessel (10) is a                combustion chamber (11) and a cyclone (12) operated                as a gas cleaner. The cyclone is connected to an                external turbine driving a compressor and                generator, the compressor supplying air to the                pressure vessel. The combustion chamber has a                fluidised bed, below which is an ash and dust                separator with a tube system which is electrically                insulated from surrounding members, and which                includes electric heating elements. These are                operated to reduce moisture collection during                starting up.
   The tubes are connected in series and the dust                laden gases are guides around them, so that the                pressure of the carrier gas is reduced to                atmospheric pressure. The tubes can be mounted in a                part of the ash and dust conveying dust which is                electrically heated and made of a heat resistant                material so that the material forming the fluidised                bed is raised to its self-ignition temp.
   ADVANTAGE -   Start up from cold is simplified, and corrosion                is reduced.
EA    (US4722182-A)      The power plant designed to burn fuel in a bed                of fluidizable particulate material contained in a                combustion chamber includes a tubular discharge                device for bed material or dust separated from                combustion gases leaving the combustion chamber.                The tubular discharge device is designed as a                cooler which is cooled by combustion air flowing                into the combustion chamber and is utilized for                pre-heating the plant upon start-up from a cold                state.
   At least a part of the tubular discharge device                is electrically insulated from parts located                upstream and downstream and from supporting                structural members and forms an electrical heater.                Upon start-up, this unit is connected to a current                source for heating the air fed to the combustion                chamber and downstream parts of the plant.

   USE - Carbon dioxide-sequestering formed material                for a building e.g. commercial building and                residential building. Can also be used for                infrastructure e.g. wall, sound barrier and                pipe.
   ADVANTAGE - The carbon dioxide-sequestering component                provides 50 percentage of water for forming the                material, so that high albedo of the material                continuously reduces carbon emission via reduced                lighting demands. The component utilizes removal or                segregation of carbon dioxide from a gaseous waste                stream and fixates in a stable non-gaseous form, so                that carbon dioxide without escapes into                atmosphere. The component is into a storage stable                form, so that sequestering gas of carbon dioxide is                facilitated to prevent carbon dioxide gas from                entering the atmosphere. The material enables by                the storage stable form a particulate matter e.g.                dust, stored above ground or underwater under                exposed conditions, so that degradation duration is                extended, thus maintaining the material in normal                environment, and hence forming the material to                prevent carbon dioxide gas from entering the                atmosphere.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Components: The CO 2sequestering                  component comprises carbonates and/or                  bicarbonates having less than -5% of &#948;                  13oxygen, calcite, aragonite, vaterite, ikaite,                  amorphous calcium carbonate, magnesite,                  barringtonite, nesquehonite, landfordite, and/or                  amorphous magnesium carbonate, calcium and/or                  magnesium, strontium, nitrogen oxides (NO x),                  sulfur oxides (SO x), volatile organic compounds,                  particulates and/or mercury, and sulfates.

The                diameter of the segment wood can be selected from 5                to 15 cm and is best to cut in the late autumn or                winter. The section is cut after selecting the tree                species, without peeling, sawing grow into a 20-30                cm section of wood, using a spatula to smooth out                the remaining needles around the section to avoid                puncturing the bag membrane, then using electric                rotating table to punch three holes with a diameter                of 1.8 cm and a depth of 3 cm, and cut with a                cutting device. The cut wood is put into a                low-pressure polyethylene bag with a diameter of                20-30 cm and a back 0.005 cm. The hole faces the                wall of the bag, 2-4 segments per bag, the                elasticity is moderate, gather the bag and tie it                tightly with rope, the oversized diameter segment                is split in half and the bag is empty.
   USE - Method for cultivating Ganoderma                lucidum.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables to cultivate Ganoderma                lucidum, where diseases of the Ganoderma lucidum                can be well prevented and prevented, and the                Ganoderma lucidum with good quality is                produced.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The bagged sections is put in the                sterilization room and use a steam furnace to                sterilize the steam. The atmospheric sterilization                time is 98-100 degrees C and is kept at 14-20                hours. The time of inoculation should be selected                when the temperature is 20 ~ 26 degrees C and the                relative humidity of the air is below 60%. After                inoculation, bury the wood in the cultivation                field, frame the wood in the shape of well, drying                and cultivating for 10 to 15 days, then opening the                wooden wedge or bark cover to observe. The wooden                wedge or bark cover has been filled with mycelium                and fixed, it will be connected, and immediately                bury the wood in the acidic soil of pH 5 ~ 6. A                place is selected with heat preservation and                moisture retention, good ventilation, proper light,                and smooth drainage. The reorganization of the                venue is based on the two borders and one                compartment, and it is formed into a 40-50 cm high                border. The soil is turned on sunny days, making                the borders in the sun, the border width is usually                1.2-1.6 meters, the border length depends on the                site, and the drainage ditch is around. The depth                of the ditch is about 16 cm, and the logs are                discharged into the ditch. Each cubic segment                requires about 15 square meters of space. The bag                is removed and burying the soil, peeling off the                plastic film, burying the segments of wood in the                soil, the interval between the segments of wood is                8-12 cm, bury them upright in the soil, slightly                exposed to the ground. The temperature in the                cultivation room should be maintained at 25 ~ 30                degrees C, and the relative humidity of the air                should be maintained at 50-60%. Every day should be                ventilated for half an hour, and the bacteria bag                will be flipped up and down once every 5-7 days.                The mycelium is covered with the bag, using a blade                to cut the two ends into a five-corner coin-shaped                round mouth. The temperature of the shed is kept at                26 ~ 30 degrees C when it comes out. The relative                humidity of the air is increased to 90% to 95%, and                provides scattered light and sufficient oxygen. The                water spray is stopped 1 week before the Ganoderma                lucidum harvest. The ventilation door is closed and                covering the floor with plastic film to collect the                spore powder. The color of Ganoderma lucidum turns                to reddish brown. The mature Ganoderma lucidum can                be harvested. The Ganoderma lucidum fruiting body                reaches the powder collection stage, that is, when                the pale white or light yellow on the edge of the                cap disappears and becomes brown or yellowish                brown, spore powder is collected by ejection. The                collected spore powder is spread into a bamboo                plaque with clean and smooth white paper, and                placed in the sun for 2 days under the sheltered                sun. The collected spore powder can also be                electrically dried, sealed with a polyethylene bag                with a thickness of 0.0004 cm, and stored in a dry                and ventilated place.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - AGRICULTURE - Preferred Condition: The mid-section wood is                  too dry, the water content is increased by                  soaking or adding water in the bag, if the                  moisture content of the tree species is high when                  cutting the section wood, it should be piled up                  and dried until it is driven into the section                  wood with a wooden wedge, and no sap flow can be                  seen. The inoculation tool can use a hole punch                  with a diameter of 1 ~ 1.2 cm, the depth of the                  penetration section is 1 cm, and the row spacing                  is 20 asterisk 20 cm, inoculating immediately                  after punching, inoculation should be carried out                  in a cool place, before inoculation, take out the                  bacteria for inoculation, cut into small pieces                  of 1 square centimeter, and gently inserting into                  the hole. After a little compression, covered                  with a wooden wedge or bark, hammered it with a                  small wooden hammer. About 30 days after the                  inoculation, a brown mycelium is formed around                  the hole, indicating that the inoculation has                  survived. The weather is dry, the soil can be                  wetted with water. During rainy season or rainy                  days, pay attention to drainage to avoid water                  accumulation on the site. The temperature rises                  to about 25 degrees C, multiple pieces of wood                  can be taken out for inspection, the bark cover                  or wooden wedges can be removed, and watered once                  every less days to keep the soil moist. After 7 ~                  10 days, the buds start to grow. During the                  period of growing buds, the humidity of the                  cultivation field is maintained at about 90%, if                  it is too dry or too wet, it will cause the buds                  to die, cultivated under suitable temperature and                  humidity conditions, the buds grow quickly, the                  stems grow first, and then the cap grows. The                  hypha growth stage requires a water content of                  65% in the medium and a relative humidity of                  65-70%. During the growth stage of fruiting                  bodies, the relative humidity of the air should                  be controlled at 85-95%. After inoculation, 0.2                  to 0.5% white vinegar aqueous solution is sprayed                  on the ground and the culture rack for                  disinfection treatment, and the white vinegar                  aqueous solution concentration is 0.4%.                  Ventilation operation is carried out 3 times a                  day, each time for 1 hour, the ventilation                  operation is set at 6: 00-7: 00, 12: 00-13: 00,                  17: 00-18: 00, maintaining proper ventilation can                  promote Ganoderma lucidum growth. As the amount                  of growing mycelium increases, the oxygen in the                  mycelium decreases, and the water droplets on the                  wall of the bag increase. The mycelium forms a                  mycelium on the cross section, combined with                  indoor spray disinfection, the bag opening is                  slightly opened to remove water vapor, increase                  oxygen, and keep the surface of the basswood less                  dry, promotes the mycelium extending into the                  xylem to spread tangentially and accumulate more                  nutrients. The control of carbon dioxide                  concentration mid-growth period are mycelium                  culture period is 0.03-0.12%, the primordia                  formation at the mushroom emergence stage and the                  stipe growth stage is 0.15-0.28%, the stipe                  differentiation and elastination period is                  0.03-0.12%. The control of the light intensity in                  the growing period is: 0 lux in the mycelium                  cultivation period, 3000-8000 lux in the mushroom                  emergence period and the elastin period.                  Attention should also be paid to preventing the                  infection of mixed bacteria, applying thick lime                  milk for prevention or treatment, or filling with                  75% alcohol cotton balls in the holes. The                  temperature in the shed is reduced by spraying                  well water to the entire greenhouse, and the                  purpose of regulating the temperature in the shed                  is obtained by adjusting the amount of water                  sprayed.
